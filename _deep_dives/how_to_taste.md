# Tasting Basics
Now here’s the bread and butter of what we as servers and bartenders do . . . we make sure that the meals the guests have exceeds their expectations and we can help that by helping them choose a wine that they will enjoy.  

But that means literally understanding the different components of our wines and how they match up against each other.  Most of the time we end up just reciting a word or phrase from the tech sheets that we can remember, but hopefully you’ll find some ways on this page that will explain things better for you.

The biggest thing to remember as you read this is that <strong>tasting wine is <em>subjective</em></strong>, meaning that what you taste might not be the same things your guests or even your spouse tastes when they get into the wine.  Some of that has to do with genetics (just like 16% of us in the world knows that Cilantro tastes like soap whereas the rest of you savages actually like that devil-herb), but you can train your senses to better appreciate wine.

## WTF is a “Taste Bud”
### <i>Taste Papillae</i>
Ok, I honestly believed that the bumps on our tongues were the actual taste buds.  Turns out they’re not.  Those bumps are actually called *taste papillae*, and they contain many sensory cells that end up looking like a peeled orange with all its sections arranged around the center.  In the very middle at the top of the taste papillae is a small indention that acts like a funnel into the center of the taste papillae. When we put something in our mouth, the chemical substances responsible for taste fill that indention.
There are 3 types of papillae that contain several taste buds with sensory cells:
#### Fungiform Papillae
These are the most common.  We have between 200 to 400 of these bumps spread all over the surface of the tongue, although these are found mostly at the tip of the tongue and at the edges.  This is why those areas are especially sensitive to taste.   The fungiform papillae not only detect taste, they contain sensory cells for touch and temperature.
Each of these contain between 3 to 5 taste buds.
#### Circumvallate Papillae
These are very large papillae that are found in a V-shape at the back of the tongue.  You can see them with the naked eye (they look round and raised.) They’re called circumvallate papillae because they are surrounded by a trench containing many glands that “rinse” the taste-producing substances into the sensory cells.  
Each of these contain several THOUSANDS of taste buds.
#### Foliate Papillae
These are located on the rear edges of the tongue and can also be seen with the naked eye.  They can be seen as several folds that lie close together.  Our tongues have about 20 foliate papillae.
Each of these contain several hundreds of taste buds.

## Taste vs Flavor
We don’t actually <em>taste</em> the flavor of our food and wine.  **Flavor**is actually how our brain interprets the combination of what we smell with our nose with what we taste and feel with our mouth.  What we smell through our <em>olfactory nerves</em> interacts with what we sense through the taste buds on our tongues to give us a flavor to whatever’s in our mouth.  

Genetics determines how many taste buds our tongues have, and those with more taste buds are called super-tasters.  Sadly, some people are just born with more or less taste buds than others.  The good news is that whatever taste buds you have will regenerate every 10-30 days if you hurt them.  That’s why you gain that sense of taste back a few days after drinking that ridiculously hot coffee.

 Genetics also determines how those  taste buds perceive bitterness.  One study had pregnant mothers drink a glass of carrot juice a day for two weeks and discovered that the mothers who liked drinking the carrot juice had babies that enjoyed carrots whereas the mothers who didn’t normally drink carrot juice but did for the study ended up with kids who disliked carrots.  Super-tasters tend to fall in that second category.

But while tasting is a genetic trait that shows up in our world by our sixth month of living, the smells we recognize are a learned experience. You can train yourself to recognize more smells as well as you can numb yourself to particular smells.  That’s why the smelly kid in 2nd grade never actually knew he was smelly . . . his body adapted to stop smelling that weird smell of oatmeal and cat that overtook the classroom.   

Humans can detect up to 10,000 different odors, at amazingly small amounts. Gas companies add a trace amount of a nasty smell to natural gas so we can detect a leak long before it becomes dangerous. We can smell that at 2 parts per billion.  

But we can go even further with smell since there are some compounds we can smell at 1 part per trillion and lower.  Those include green bell pepper, mold, roasted oats, and boiled seafood.

We are able to smell through two different routes, our nose and the back of our mouth.  Sniffing through the nose is called <em>orthonasal smell</em>. The aroma you get through the back of your mouth is your <em>retronasal smell</em>.  

So when you look to tasting wine, it’s best to look at the different tastes or flavor profiles that our tongues can sense.

## 5 Basic Tastes our Tongues Recognize (and a bonus)
Unless you think Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a Brontosaurus, then odds are you recognize that humans have evolved over millions of years.  And since we’ve had to eat, even when our sense of smell was hampered by the smoke from our cave’s fire, we had to evolve a sense that could protect us from anything dangerous we put in our mouth.  Enter in your taste buds.

Since our ancient ancestors lived in a tropical forest-like environment, they spent a lot of time running around naked and eating leaves and vegetables.  They had to learn really quickly what may or may not be toxic, so we developed the ability to taste toxins and interpret it as “bitter”.  That’s why a lot of vegetables taste bitter, they tend to contain an element that if we ate too much of it it would be toxic for us. 

We learned that if you were going to listen to a snake and pick an apple off of a tree, through experimentation our tongues told us that if we bit into the apple too soon it would taste sour and tart whereas if we waited a bit for it to ripen then we’d taste a much sweeter apple full of natural sugars we’d need for energy. You know, in case the saber-toothed tiger whose cave we stole comes back.  You’re gonna want that energy as you run away.

Once they figured out how to team up and fight back against the predators, our ancestors started eating meat.  This gave us a source of protein, but it was only once we started cooking the meat or letting it age a little bit (you know, ferment so the sweet and sour interact), we discovered that savory Umami flavor.

Fat told us which foods were a great source of energy and fatty acids.  Bitterness told us which vegetables to stay away from.  We like salt to since the vegetables we eat lack natural sodium. Umami led us to alternate sources of protein and essential amino acids.  Our sense of taste evolved to detect non-volatile molecules that we cannot smell.

#### Sweet
This is the taste of natural sugars found in many fruits and honey.  This includes derivatives like fructose or lactose, and even other types of substances that activate the sensory cells that respond to sweetness (alcoholic drinks for example).
#### Salty
The taste of sodium and chloride (salt crystals) and the mineral salts potassium and magnesium.
#### Sour
The taste of acidic solutions like lemon juice and organic acids.  This sensation is caused by hydrogen ions, chemical symbol: H+, split off by an acid dissolved in a watery solution.
#### Bitter
The taste of 35 different proteins in the sensory cells that respond to bitter substances.  
#### Umami (Savory)
The taste comes from protein building blocks (amino acids) found naturally in protein-rich foods like meats and cheeses as well as some vegetables and fruits like ripe tomatoes or asparagus, and the taste is somewhat similar to the taste of a meat broth.  This is the signal that the dish is rich in protein and tends to evoke pleasant emotions in most people.   
There are sensory cells specifically made for this taste and was discovered by a Japanese researcher around 1910.
#### Bonus  — FAT
People used to think that preference for fatty foods was based solely on their smell and texture, but newer research suggests that there are probably receptors specifically for fat.  It is caused by certain fatty acids that enzymes in the saliva split from fatty foods.

## Wine Temperature
Somewhere along the way, in one of the umpteen-million wine tastings I have participated in, one presenter said something that stuck in my mind: <em>”Room temperature wine doesn’t mean the room temperature in Texas. You’re looking for room temperature in 16th century France so more in your 60’s than in your 80’s, even for red wines.”</em>

Fun Fact: One of the first modern refrigerators was advertised as able to cool a bottle of champagne in 10 minutes.  Yup, wine is EVERYWHERE.

It’s a little more complicated than that, but that speaks to a big truth. ***Wine Temperature Changes the Taste***
**Cold temperatures** enhance the perception of bitterness.   This is why we serve sweet white wines chilled, to keep their sweetness in balance.
**Warm temperatures** increase the impact of sweetness and alcohol.  

### Wine Temp Recommendations
- Notes on temp
	- Wine will warm up in the glass, so we always try to serve it a few degrees colder than the recommended drinking temp. 
	- A wine bottle will drop 4° every ten minutes in a standard refrigerator.
		- Likewise, a bottle will warm up 4° every ten minutes at room temperature (70°)
	- As wine warms, it releases aromas which greatly impacts taste.
		- To taste the difference, take a bottle of Chardonnay and pour a glass
		- Put that glass back in the fridge while you let the bottle warm up to 45°
		- Now pour a glass and smell that one
			- Pull the one out of the fridge and smell it
		- Then compare the taste of the two
- White Wines
	- Champagne — 40°
	- Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling — 43°
	- Rosé, Prosecco — 45°
	- Chardonnay, Viognier, White Zinfandel — 50°
	- White Burgundy — 52°
- Red Wines
	- Pinot Noir — 50°
	- Beaujolais — 54°
	- Zinfandel — 59°
	- Cabernet, Bordeaux, Merlot, Shiraz — 63°
	- Port — 65°

## Are you a “Super-Taster”?
First thing you need to figure out is <strong> how much of your food do you taste?</strong>  A professor at the University of Florida (Go Vols!) named Linda Bartoshuk came up with the terms **super-tasters** and **non-tasters** while she was studying the genetic differences of taste.  

What she discovered was that about 25% of the population is extremely sensitive to the taste of bitter tasting chemical  (6-n-propylthiouracil or PROP) and 25-30% of the population couldn’t even taste it, leaving about 45-50% of the population as **average-tasters**.

The 25% of the population that was extremely sensitive to the PROP cringed at even the smallest amount and she called these the **super-tasters**.  Turns out this group have many more visible **papillae** or *taste buds* than everyone else, meaning that they have many more taste cells with receptors for bitter taste.  It also means that they are more sensitive to the other basic tastes, just not as much.  <em>Because they can taste so much more, they tend to be very picky eaters</em>. Super-tasters tend to not like hot, spicy foods because the taste cells are surrounded by pain receptors therefore they also have more pain receptors than average and non-tasters.  Super-tasters tend to eat less vegetables since a lot of vegetables have a bitter taste, as well as they tend to prefer sweet, high-fat foods a lot less than average tasters.  They seem to not like alcohol as much and are less likely to smoke than the others.

Average tasters tend to like most foods, and they don’t really find the need to cover their food with salt or sriracha. 

Non-tasters very much prefer high-fat, sweeter foods.  They also tend to drink more alcohol than the other two categories.	

### Test Which You are
In order to figure out whether you’re a super-taster, an average-taster, or a non-taster like I am, there’s a great little test you can do.

#### Equipment
- A glass of red wine
- A sheet of wax paper
- A hole punch

#### Steps
1. <strong>Drink the glass of wine.  </strong> I mean, you really only need to stain your tongue with the wine, but there are sober children in China so be a hero and drink the glass.
2. <strong>Cut up the wax paper.  </strong> Take your hole punch and apply it to the wax paper.  If you need further instructions for this step, you need to go find an adult.
3. <strong>Lick the wax paper. </strong> Take  one of those little wax circles you’ve made and place it on the front part of your tongue for a few seconds. 
4. <strong>Count the bumps.</strong> Now look at that little circle and count the number

--- 

## Tasting Myths
- Hot or Spicy is a “Taste”
	- WRONG — Technically this is just a pain signal sent but the nerves that transmits touch and temperature sensations.  So any time we season food with chili peppers or sriracha, we’re literally trying to torture the diner.
- Tongues have specific “Zones” for tastes
	- WRONG — The basic tastes of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory can actually be sensed by all parts of the tongue.
	- The truth is that the tip and sides of the tongue are more sensitive than the middle of the tongue, and that’s true for all tastes EXCEPT for bitter.
		- The back of our tongue is VERY SENSITIVE to bitter tastes.  This is apparently to protect us so that we can spit out poisonous or spoiled foods before they enter the throat and are swallowed.
	- The other truth is that each taste bud has a hierarchy for what it IS sensitive for, but they all sense all the components
		- The front of the tongue taste buds are more sensitive to sweetness
		- Towards the back of the sides of the tongue is more sensitive to salt.
		- Towards the middle of the sides of the tongue is more sensitive to sour.

## How Wine-Nerds taste wine

### Step 1: Look at the Wine
- Fill the glass about one-third full.
	- NEVER FILL MORE THAN HALF
- Pick the glass up by the stem.
	- Holding the glass by its bowl hides some of the liquid from view, the heat of your hand warms the wine, and your fingerprints could blur the color.  So grab it by the stem.
- Focus on three visual aspects of the wine: Hue, Intensity, and Clarity
	- Hue — This is the true color of the wine. 
		- Hue is best judged by tilting the glass and looking at the wine through the rim.  This lets you see the variation from the deepest part of the liquid out to its edges.
	- Intensity
		- View this looking straight down on the wine from above.
	- Clarity — Whether the wine is brilliant or cloudy with particles.
		- Most evident when the light is shining sideways through the glass.
- Swirl and look again
	- Grip the stem of the glass between your thumb and forefinger, let the base sit on the table, and swirl the wine by rotating your wrist.  Swirl until the wine has climbed nearly to the rim and then stop. 
	- As the wine settles, a transparent film will appear on the inside of the glass falling slowly and irregularly down the sides in the wine’s “tears” or “legs”.  
		- This is an indication of the alcohol level.  The more tears or legs, the more alcohol. 

### Step 2: Smell the Wine
- Swirling the wine to view the legs is also your introduction into the next stage of wine tasting, smelling the wine.  
	- When the wine is agitated, it vaporizes a little bit that releases a lot of aromas into the air inside the glass.
- There’s no <em>right way</em> to smelling the wine, other than make sure you stick your nose deep inside that glass. 
	- Some people say take one long deep breath.
	- Some people suggest taking two or three quick little inhalations.
	- Heck, some people even plug one nostril and sniff, then plug the other nostril and sniff.
- The point is, you want to get as much of that vaporized liquid full of aromas into the back of your nasal passages so that your brain can best process as many of the aromas as possible.

### Step 3: Taste the Wine
- Now the wine nerds are finally ready for the best part, tasting the wine.  But just like everything else, over the past few thousand years of drinking wine, we’ve found ways to really taste as much of the wine as we can.
- First, take a sip.
	- Don’t drink too much or your body will force you to swallow what’s in your mouth.  Instead, try to sip in about a third to half an ounce.
		- You want enough wine to be able to coat every last bit of your mouth that could possibly tell you about the wine.  
			- That’s all sides of your tongue, the soft palate in the roof of your mouth, the back of your throat, and even the insides of your cheek.
- Keep the wine in your mouth.
	- Again, you don’t want the wine to go straight from the glass into your stomach.  Yes, there are taste buds that this would interact with, but most people suggest holding the wine in your mouth from 10-15 seconds at least.
- Roll the wine around in your mouth.
	- You want to taste everything you can in the wine so bring as much of your tasting organ into contact with the wine. 
		- You can taste how astringent the tannins are through the inner sides of your cheeks.
		- You can taste the bitterness and/or alcohol heat in the back of your throat. 
		- The sweetness on the front of your tongue.
- Aerate the wine a bit more. 
	- Before you swallow, purse your lips a little bit and suck in some air over the wine sitting on your tongue.  You’ll make a little bubbling sound that amuses small children and upsets classy dinner partners.
		- This brings even more aromas into the retronasal passage that connects your throat and nose.
- Chew then swallow.
	- Yeah, that’s right, the last step before you swallow is to actually <i>chew</i> a liquid.
		- What this does is make sure that your mouth moves around a bit so the wine can get into every nook and crevice, making sure that every possible taste bud gets a shot at analyzing the wine.
	- Then swallow.
		
### Step 4: Focus on the Finish
- You’ve now swallowed the wine, <em>but you are not done!!!</em>
	- Now you want to analyze how the wine “finishes”, or how the wine plays with your senses after you’ve swallowed.
		- The better the wine is, the more complex, profound, and long-lasting the residual flavors and aromas will be.
		- With really great wines (and sensitive tasters), the flavors and aromas could last over a minute!
- After you swallow, exhale gently and slowly.
	- Try to exhale through both your mouth and your nose.  This will really activate the retronasal passage.

### Bonus: Wine Nerd Order of Tasting

There are a few rules to follow when deciding which wines to drink in which order
#### Rule 1: Young before Old
As wines get older they become more flavorful and complex, therefore it’s best to enjoy older wines after younger wines.  This will let you really savor those complex flavors without having to worry about the next wine to drink.

#### Rule 2: Dry before Sweet
Sweet wines tend to leave you feeling satiated whereas dry wines encourage more drinking. Likewise, the acidity that balances out a lot of sweet wines will interfere with the flavors of a dry wine.

#### Rule 3: White before Reds
Red wines always have just a bit thicker of a mouthfeel than almost all white wines meaning you really want to start with the light crisp white wines.  

#### Rule 4: Dessert Wines Last
They are so heavily fortified and rich that they will overwhelm any wines you try to taste afterwards.

#### Wines to Drink in Order
Here’s an ordered list of the wines to drink in a tasting so that you can best experience your wines.  
1. Riesling (dry)
2. Pinot Grigio
3. Vinho Verde
4. Sauvignon Blanc
5. Gewürztraminer
6. Chenin Blanc
7. Viognier
8. Chardonnay
9. Rosé / Clariet 
10. Pinot Noir
11. Sangiovese
12. Tempranillo
13. Grenache
14. Zinfandel
15. Barbera
16. Merlot
17. Shiraz / Syrah
18. Malbec
19. Pinotage
20. Cabernet Sauvignon
21. Petit Verdot
22. Sweet [White before Red]
23. Dessert Wines [non-fortified]
24. Fortified Wines

# Tasting Exercises
Here are some various tasting exercises that will help train you to better experience wine when you taste it.
## Tasting Tannin
Remember that tannins are the compounds found in the grape’s skin, seeds, and stems that give that “drying” effect to your mouth.  Because of this, tannins pair especially well with dishes that have a lot of fat or meat.

### Tannin in the Wild
Tannin comes from two places when it comes to wine: the grapes and oak aging.

**Tannin from Grapes** comes primarily from the skins and seeds of the grapes.  The longer they are in contact with the wine-juice, the more tannins they impart to the wine.  This kind of tannin will taste more “green” in the wine and will really hit the sides and front of your mouth.

**Tannin from Oak** comes from the wood itself as the wine sits in contact with it.  That means that the longer the wine sits in contact, the more tannins it will take in.  Also, the age of the wood used imparts different amounts of tannin into the wine.  New Oak that has never been used to contain fluid before will leech out more tannins than used oak.  Tannins from oak taste more smooth and round as they hit your palate and the center of your tongue.

**Non-Wine Tannin** can be found in unsweetened black tea.  This is such a pure example of tannin that damn near every wine website on the internet uses this.  But other high-tannin foods include walnuts, almonds, dark chocolate, cinnamon, and clove.

### Tannin Exercise 1: Tea Comparison (non-alc)
#### Supplies Needed
- 3 mugs of hot water
- 3 black tea bags

#### Steps
1. Steep the tea in each mug
	- 2 minutes for the first mug
	- 4 minutes for the second mug
	- 8 minutes for the third mug
2. Let the tea cool you savage
3. Taste
	- Start with the two-minute tea, then the four-minute, then the eight-minute tea
	- Swish the liquid around in your mouth before swallowing
4. Analyze
	- Could you feel the difference?
	- Was there a specific part of your mouth you felt a bigger effect?

### Tannin Exercise 2: Tannin in Red Wine
#### Supplies Needed
- A red wine without residual sugar
- 1 black tea bag
- 2 wine glasses

#### Steps
1. Prepare
	- Pour an equal amount of wine into the two glasses
	- Steep the tea bag in one of the glasses for 10 minutes
	- Remove the tea bag
2. Taste
	- Taste the control wine first.  Swish it all around in your mouth.  Chew at it. Then swallow.
	- Now pinch your nose so you don’t smell the tea in the wine
	- Take a small taste of the tea-wine
		- You should notice two primary aspects
3. Analyze
	- Bitterness should be the most prominent aspect you taste in the tea-wine
		- If this is extreme then you may be a super-taster
		- If you can’t taste it as much as your neighbor, you’re probably not as sensitive to IBU’s (like them IPA’s, do ya?)
	- Next you should feel a drying, astringent sensation on your tongue.  Like fine sandpaper when you brush your tongue to the roof of your mouth

### Tannin Wine Comparison
If you’d like to taste three different styles of wine to do a real life comparison of tannin in wine, here are three styles to try.

1. Beaujolais
	- Remember to serve this at the right temperature!
	- Start with this one since it has the least tannins
2. California Merlot
	- You should definitely feel a bit of difference between this one and the Beaujolais
3. Bordeaux
	- This one should feel completely different in your mouth-hole.

## Tasting Body
Body is the sense of weight, richness, heaviness, or even the feeling of thickness that a wine leaves in your mouth.  As a general rule, the more alcohol in a wine, the more body it will have.  That means that wines from warmer climates tend to be much more full-bodied than cool climate wines.

### Body in the Wild
You know how some people (me, I'm some people) can't stand mushrooms because of how squishy and slimey they feel in your mouth? 
That's what makes me think of body as the tongue's touch. How does the wine or food <i>feel</i> in your mouth?

### Body Exercise 1: Milk Comparison (non-alc)
#### Supplies Needed
- 4 glasses
- 1/4 cup of skim milk
- 1/4 cup of 2% milk
- 1/4 cup of whole milk
- 1/4 cup of heavy cream

#### Steps
1. Taste the milk from lightest bodied to fullest.
	- Start with the skim milk and feel how it feels in your mouth.  This is where your light-bodied wines will sit.  Notice how quickly the feeling of the milk leaves your senses after you swallow.
	- Then sip the 2% and compare that feeling to the skim.
	- Then the whole milk.  Now you’re starting to get to your fuller-bodied wines.
	- Then sip the heavy cream and really feel the weight of that in your mouth.  
2. Analyze
	- Switch up the order and compare.  Train your mouth to distinguish the differences in the weight.

### Body Exercise 2: Juice Comparison (non-alc)
#### Supplies Needed
- 4 glasses
- lemon juice
- orange juice
- pineapple juice
- mango juice

#### Steps
1. Taste from lightest to fullest
	- Lemon juice first
	- Orange next
	- Pineapple juice third
	- Finish with the mango juice
2. Analyze
	- Notice how the juice gets a fuller feeling in your mouth as it gets sweeter.  That’s an example of how sugar makes a wine gain body.

### Body in Wine Comparison
If you’d like to taste the different levels of body in wines, here are a few options to compare against each other.

#### Body in White Wines Comparison
1. Italian Pinot Grigio
	- Here’s your beer of wine.  This should feel as light as the skim milk on your tongue.
2. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc
	- Starting to get a bit more body but not a lot more on this one.
3. White Burgundy
	- You should be able to notice a weight change between this and the Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio
4. Barrel-Fermented Chardonnay
	- This big boy should feel completely different in your mouth than the other two.  Notice how that feeling lingers after you swallow.

#### Body in Red Wines Comparison
1. Willamette Valley Pinot Noir
	- This cool climate will give you an elegant light-bodied red wine.
2. California Merlot
	- Warm climate but a lighter grape gives you a light to medium-bodied red.
3. Zinfandel
	- This grape will give you a medium to full-bodied red wine.
4. Malbec
	- The tannins in this bad-boy combined with a warm climate let it be a full-bodied red wine.

---

## Tasting Acidity
Now you’re talking about tasting that mouth-watering factor in wine, you know that pucker that makes you want to drink a bit more.  This is the driver behind what makes some white wines so refreshing in a hot afternoon.   

Tasting acidity will tell you a lot about the climate that the grapes were grown in.  A cooler climate tends to grow grapes with a higher acidity (since they don’t ripen as fully) whereas warmer climates produce low acid wines that taste smooth and creamy.

### Acidity in the Wild
Take a bite of a crisp green apple, taste a lemon, or sip on some lemonade and notice the acidity.  

### Acidity Exercise 1: Red Wine Comparison
#### Supplies Needed
- 2 glasses of red wine
- 1/2 lemon or distilled white vinegar (a dash)

#### Steps
1. Prepare
	- Squeeze the 1/2 lemon juice into one glass of wine 
	- Or put a dash of distilled into the glass of wine
	- Keep the other one unaltered as your control glass
2. Taste
	- Taste the control wine first and swish it around in your mouth
	- Then pinch your nose and taste the other wine
		- It’s important to not smell the wine
	- Feel how different that wine feels in your mouth
3. Analyze 
	- The altered wine should feel lighter than the control wine
	- The altered wine should make your mouth water more, give you a bit of pucker.
	- The altered wine should display more of the wine’s natural bitter and drying notes.
	- Heck, that altered wine may even have a longer finish that’s a bit tart and / or tingly.

### Acidity Exercise 2: Fruit Juices (non-alc)
#### Supplies Needed
- 5 glasses of about 4oz of water
- Juice from 1/4 of an Orange
- Juice from 1/4 of a Grapefruit
- Juice from 1/2 of a Lemon
- Juice from 1/2 of a Lime

#### Steps
1. Prepare your glasses
	- Set up your first glass water unaltered as your control glass
	- Put the orange juice in the second glass of water
	- Put the grapefruit juice in the third glass of water
	- Put the lemon juice in the fourth glass of water
	- Put the lime juice in the fifth glass of water
2. Taste in order of least to most acidic
	- Control water glass first followed by orange, then grapefruit, then lemon, and finish with the lime water.
3. Analyze
	- Feel how the increasing acidity changes inside your mouth.  
	- Try pinching your nose and going back through and see if you can feel the differences and pinpoint which is which.

## Tasting Sweetness
All wine is dry, some just has a bit of residual sugar left in it to make it sweet. 

### Sweetness in the Wild
I'm not saying that humans are inherintly lazy, but we developed our taste for sweetness because it screams <i>EASY ENERGY</i> at us. 

### Sweetness Exercise 1: Lemon water (non-alc)
#### Supplies Needed
- 16oz glass half full of water
- 2 lemons
- 1 cup of sugar

#### Steps
1. Squeeze 
	- Squeeze in the juice of the lemons into the water and stir
2. Taste
	- Taste the mixture and notice how tart it is
3. Sweeten
	- Stir in 1 teaspoon of sugar
4. Taste
	- Taste the difference in how sweet the lemon juice is
5. Repeat
	- Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you hit that perfect level of sweetness that balances the acidity of the lemon.

### Sweetness Exercise 2: Red Wine 
#### Supplies Needed 
- 2 glasses of dry red wine
- 1 tsp sugar

#### Steps
1. Prepare
	- Set one glass of red wine off to be your control wine
	- Stir the sugar into the other glass of wine until completely dissolved
2. Taste
	- Sip on the control wine first and try to search for any sweetness and take note of the wine feels on your tongue
	- Sip on the sweetened wine next and notice the differences
3. Analyze
	- Compare the aromas and flavors of the two wines.  What does the sugar do?
	- How does the wine feel on the tip of your tongue?
	- What taste sensations do you feel after you’ve swallowed?
		- Does it feel more viscous and oily on the middle-back of your tongue?

## Tasting Alcohol
Okay, this one should be fairly self-explanatory but there are a couple of aspects to note. First, genetics has a lot to do with how each person tastes alcohol, some taste it as spicy, some taste it as “hot”, and some people just love the bejeezus out of it.  Second thing to note is that alcohol adds body to a wine, so the higher ABV, the fuller-bodied the wine will feel in your mouth.

### Alcohol in the Wild
Alcohol is everywhere on Earth (even in some Southern Baptist households).  This is just what naturally happens to a fruit juice as it ages and ferments.  That means a rotting apple even has some alcohol in it. Chimpanzees have been known to enjoy getting drunk on fermented fruit.

### Alcohol Exercise 1: Red Wine 
#### Supplies Needed
- 2 glasses of a dry red wine
- 1 tsp of vodka

#### Steps
1. Prepare
	- Set aside the first glass of red wine as your control wine
	- Stir in the teaspoon of vodka into your second glass of wine
2. Taste
	- Taste the control wine first.  Make sure you get a feel for every bit of the wine in every part of your mouth.  Chew before your swallow even.
	- Then pinch your nose and taste the vodka-wine the same way. Pay attention to the sensations in your mouth and not the flavor of the wine.
3. Analyze
	- When tasting the vodka-wine, notice how the wine will feel “spicier” and will make your tongue have tiny prickles all over.
	- Pay attention to how thick the wine feels.
	- Notice how long it takes the little prickles to subside after you swallow the vodka-wine.
	- Does it have a hot little aftertaste?

### Alcohol in Wine Comparison
No really, just look at the ABV on the different bottles and see if you can tell the difference.

## Tasting Oak
Of course part of tasting oak is tasting tannins, especially in white wines, but this segment is all about the oaky part. 

The longer the wine sits in the oak, the more the vanillan compound will leave the oak that it lived in for the wine that it loves, which is why many oaked wines have a vanilla taste.

Oak also tends to hide or smooth out a lot of the fruit flavors in wine.

### Oak in the Wild
#### American vs French Oak
Just like we tend to be more brash and assertive than our Parisian cousins, American Oak versus French Oak share similar differences.
	- American oak imparts more coconut, vanilla, and sweet spice flavors when it interacts with wine.
		- French oak tends to impart more dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean, and savory spice flavors to the wine.
	- French oaked wine can come across as more elegant and complex due to the more subtle effect of the milder oak.
		- American oaked wine comes across as much more assertive and bold.

#### New Oak vs Old Oak
Like a tea bag, the more times you use an oak barrel, the less flavor it imparts.  
	- The first time you use a barrel, it imparts the most flavor
	- The second time, it imparts a lot less flavor
	- The third time you use a barrel, it hardly imparts any flavor
	- Any time after that and the barrel is pretty much neutral and drained of off all its vanillan.

### Oak Exercise: Campfire Cookout (non-alc)
#### Supplies Needed
- Box of Cheerios
- Ziplock Baggies
- Marshmallows
- Skewers
- Gas Stove, Kitchen Torch, Candle, Really really strong lighter
- Accident-prone should also have a fire-extinguisher handy

#### Steps
1. Cheerios
	- First pour some cheerios in a ziplock baggie, squeeze out the air, and close
	- Smash up the cheerios.  Go all hulk on that bad boy.
	- Take in a big whiff of those cheerios.  The toasty, wheat notes of the cereal are very similar to those in oaked wines
2. Marshmallow
	- Skewer the marshmallow on a skewer
	- Roast the marshmallow until it is charred.  You aren’t eating this (necessarily), you <em>want</em> the char.
	- Take in a big whiff of that char.  In red wines, oak leaves the impression of campfire smoke or the smell of a burnt marshmallow

## Tasting Aroma and Flavors
Now I listed this one last on the tasting page because it’s the one thing that every restaurant wine tasting class <em>does</em> cover.  We tend to think of wines as having certain “flavors” so when we learn about them we learn about those flavors and sometimes how they interact with the different dishes.  

But since wine tasting is so subjective, does that even matter?  Should we tell the guests what flavors to expect . . . what if they aren’t as trained as you are and all the taste is a “red wine flavor”?  Have we damaged their experience by leaving them wanting?  

That’s up to you.  

### Aroma and Flavors in the Wild
### Aroma and Flavors Exercise 1: Tech Sheet Tasting
This is a fairly simple “exercise” that really depends on which wines you’re drinking.  What you want to do is take the wine’s “Tech Sheet” or whatever guidance the winemaker / vendor has given you about what to expect from the wine.  Look at that sheet and find the flavors and aromas and then choose a two groups of items from that list. 
#### Supplies Needed
- 2 Groups of items that mirror the tasting notes
	- Example: Chardonnay
		- Lemon zest and pineapple juice in one group
		- slices of banana, apple, pear, peach, apricot, and fresh butter in the other group
	- Example: Cabernet Sauvignon
		- Blackberries, black cherries in one group
		- coffee, vanilla, spices, dark chocolate and bell pepper in the other group
- A blindfold
- A glass of the target wine

#### Steps
1. Smell
	- Set up the two groups of items and the glass of wine in front of you
	- Put your blindfold on and smell each group
	- Swirl the wine and stick your nose in the glass and smell
	- Then smell one group and smell the wine again
2. Taste
	- Now take another deep whiff of one of the item groups
	- Then swirl and taste the wine
	- Repeat with the other group		
3. Analyze
	- Were you able to notice the different flavors?
	- Can you pinpoint individual flavors?
	- Do any of the aromas or flavors remind you of any specific memories?
	- Do either of the item group flavors show up more on the finish after you’ve swallowed?

### Aroma and Flavors Exercise 2: Identify This Smell (non-alc)
The best way to learn flavors and aromas is to get as much experience identifying different smells while blindfolded.  There are numerous kits for sale on the internet full of essential oils or scratch-and-sniff cards that will help you learn, but these can be expensive.  (The master sommelier wine aroma kit with 88 wine aromas is $450 on Amazon as of 9/30/22!)

This is a much cheaper way.

#### Supplies Needed
- Blindfold and a Partner
- Lychee
- Pencil Shavings
- Mushrooms
- Bacon
- Rock
- Sage
- Raspberries
- Cassis
- Lime Zest
- Orange Blossom Water

#### Steps
1. Prepare
	- First put your blindfold on
	- Then have your partner lay out the items in a specific order 
		- Or your partner can place them one at a time in front of you
2. Smell
	- Once the item is set, your partner should let you know so you can smell it without touching the item. The only clues you want are the ones from your sense of smell since that accounts for the majority of our taste.
3. Analyze
	- Describe what the smell reminds you of as you go down the list. 
	- Have your partner tell you if you got it right or wrong.
	- Continue to describe it if you got it right.  Does the smell remind you of a specific memory? Can you tell a story about that memory (helps you lock in that smell).
	- If you got it wrong, have your partner add it to the end of your row so that you can try again before you take off the blindfold.
