</header>
    <div class="wrapper">
      <nav>
        <ul></ul>
      </nav>

      <section>
        <dl>
    <dt>ABV</dt>
        <dd>
            *Alcohol By Volume*
            Alcohol tastes like "heat" or "spice" on the tongue (based on
            the taster's particular genetics). Higher ABV wines tend to be
            fuller-bodied.  I assume you're 21 reading this so if I have to
            explain alcohol more than that, then you've got some issues.
        </dd>
    <dt>Acidity</dt>
        <dd>
            *One of the Hard Components*  
            Acidity is the *pucker factor* in the wine. How tart it tastes.
            Kind of like drinking lemonade from the weird kid's stand at the 
            end of the block.  You know, the kid whose mom doesn't let him 
            ever even see sugar? Yeah, so that's acididty.
        </dd>
    <dt>Aeration</dt>
        <dd>
            This is the technical term for letting a wine "breathe." The goal 
            here is to allow the wine to open up release all the different primary 
            aromas.  This is done for "tight" and "young" red wines that are meant to age.
        </dd>
    <dt>Aging</dt>
        <dd>
            That slow, inevitable slide into oblivion that everything experiences. 
            Except for wine, it just makes some of them creamier, softer, and 
            changes the bouquet.
        </dd>
    <dt>American Oak</dt>
        <dd>
            Made in the Good Ole U S of A, this oak has a tighter grain than French and 
            just like us, tends to be louder and bolder than its cousin as well. This means
            that it's used primarly for aging Merlot, Zinfandel, and Cabernet Sauvignon. 
        </dd>
    <dt>American Viticultural Area (AVA)</dt>
        <dd>
            A specific area of grapegrowing land that the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) 
            has designated and named.  Useful when trying to keep climates and best styles straight.
        </dd>
    <dt>Aperitif</dt>
        <dd>
            French for "Pregaming" your meal. In theory it's supposed to stimulate
            your appetite, but you're not fooling anyone ya lush. But used correctly
            these tend to be dry wines served before a meal.
        </dd>
    <dt>Auslese</dt>
        <dd>
            German classifaction based on the sugar content of the grapes when they're picked. 
            To make an Auslesen, they hand select specific bunches based on whether they're riper than
            the grapes they'd choose for a spätlese, but not as ripe or sugar-laden as the ripest bunches.
        </dd>
    <dt>Autolysis</dt>
        <dd>
            This is the technical term for what happens to the wine that touches the dead bodies of the yeast cells, 
            the lees. The more this happens, the more the wine changes towards a richer creamier wine with 
            flavors and aromas of bread and toast. When making Champagne or Cava, this happens in the neck of the upside-
            down bottles where the yeast carcases lie during the second fermentation.
        </dd>
    <dt>Balance</dt>
        <dd>
            Means the same thing in wine as it does in life.  All the parts are pretty much perfectly matched so that 
            none of them overpower the others. The *hard componenets* of acidity and tannin balance the *soft 
            components* of sweetness, fruit, oak, and alcohol. Now I'm gonna picture them as fat kids at recess on a 
            see-saw.
        </dd>
    <dt>Barrique</dt>
        <dd>
            French for small barrel.
        </dd>
    <dt>Bâtonnage</dt>
        <dd>
            Another one of those dang French words, this is the process where lees 
            are stirred as the wine ages.  This gives rich, bready notes to the wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Body</dt>
        <dd>
            How the wine feels in your mouth. Body can range from the 
            feeling of skim milk (light) to whole milk (full-bodied) on
            your tongue
        </dd>
    <dt>Bouquet</dt>
        <dd>
            Technically the "bouquet" is the Tertiary (third) set of Aromas
            when smelling wine, the aromas that come from aging and oaking. 
            But for our sake because half y'all lost your sense of smell at 
            some point in the past year, we will consider the bouquet as ALL the aromas.
        </dd>
    <dt>Brix</dt>
        <dd>
            This is a way to measure how much sugar is in a grape, in the must, or in the wine at the time of 
            harvest.  How ripe the grape was.  Most table-wine grapes are harvested at 21-25 Brix.
        </dd>
    <dt>Brut</dt>
        <dd>
            This is NOT the big guy you use to storm the castle with in search of your Princess 
            and the six-fingered guy that killed your friend's father, that's *Brute* with an 'e'. 
            Brut is a very dry sparkling wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Budburst</dt>
        <dd>
            One of the most important dates for grape producers, this is when the vines 
            push water out to their branches and grapes begin to start growing.  The fruit
            is no longer protected by the vine so if a frost comes along, it will suffer damage.
        </dd>
    <dt>Carbonic Fermentation</dt>
        <dd>
            The phrase Stolpman Vineyards uses for *Carbonic Maceration*
        </dd>
    <dt>Carbonic Maceration</dt>
        <dd>
            Instead of some hairy French dude stomping on the grapes in his bare feet to get the juice 
            out of them into contact with the yeast so it ferments and turns into wine, this method 
            takes whole grapes and seals them into a stainless steel tank that's then filled with CO<sub>2</sub>. 
            This lets the grapes ferment from the inside out, producing a much lighter and less tannic wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Cava</dt>
        <dd>
            Sparkling wine made in Southern Spain and Portugal.  Cheaper than 
            Champagne because it's not from that small little part of France.
        </dd>
    <dt>Chaptalization</dt>
        <dd>
            The process of adding sugar to a the juice before or during fermentation because the grapes were underripe 
            when picked so the yeast didn't have enough sugar to eat.
        </dd>
    <dt>Cool Climate</dt>
        <dd>
            Cool climate regions have all four seasons with cooler summer 
            days and a shorter growing season.  Most of the time the average 
            growing season temperature ranges between 55˚ to 59˚F.  Those regions
            include: New Zealand, France, Oregon, Italy, Germany, Canada.  
            Wines from cool climates tend to be light-bodied, crisp, with low 
            alcohol content.
        </dd>
    <dt>Corked</dt>
        <dd>
            When someone tastes the wine after it has been presented, this is one of the things they're looking 
            for. When a tainted cork is used to cork the bottle, the wine will end up giving off
            a musty, moldy-newspaper flavor and aroma. That wine is "corked" and should be returned.
        </dd>
    <dt>Cuvée</dt>
        <dd>
            Pronounced *KOO-vay*, when in reference to Champagne it refers specifically
            to the first-pressed and most desired juice.  When not talking about bubbly wines, 
            cuvée refers to a particular blend of a wine that's typically of more than one grape 
            variety.
        </dd>
    <dt>Délestage</dt>
        <dd>
            See *Devatting*
        </dd>
    <dt>Devatting</dt>
        <dd>
            AKA *délestage*. While the wine is fermenting, all the stems, skins, seeds and physical junk 
            floats to the top and creates a "cap". At this point, the winemakers will drain the juice from a valve 
            at the bottom of the tank and leave the solids in the container.  Then they'll pour the wine juice back 
            over the solids for the purpose of increasing the extraction of color, flavor, tannins, and aromas from the 
            solids.
        </dd>
    <dt>Disgorgement</dt>
        <dd>
            AKA *dégorgement*. During the second fermentation for sparkling wines, the wine bottles are held upside down 
            so the yeast and sediment sinks to the neck. Once fermentation is done, the necks are frozen and the cap is 
            removed. With the cap removed, the CO<sub>2</sub> pushes the frozen sediment out, disgorges it.
        </dd>
    <dt>Dry</dt>
        <dd>
            *Opposite of Sweet*
            Not to be confused with tannin, Dry is the word to be used in relation
            to how much *residual sugar* is left in the wine.  
            All wines are dry.
        </dd>
    <dt>Duke</dt>
        <dd>
            Duke Paoa Kahinu Mokoe Hulikohola Kahanamoku was an Olympic Swimmer 
            born on August 24<sup>th</sup>, 1890 who went on to become the **Ambassador 
            of Aloha** for the Hawaiian Islands which is why TS Restaurants named
            the restaurant after him, to focus us on that same *Aloha*.

    <dt>Duke's Beach House Maui</dt>
        <dd>This is the restaurant you supposedly work at if you're reading this</dd>
    <dt>Ermitage Puncheons</dt>
        <dd>Ermitage is a maker of wooden barrels.  Fancy made to order French oak barrels and puncheons.</dd>
    <dt>Field Blend</dt>
        <dd>
            Several different grape varietes are planted and harvested together to make a single wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Fining</dt>
        <dd>
            Instead of filtering out all the solids and particulate from the wine, this process uses chemicals to bind 
            with the solids and then they sink to the bottom of the wine so that it's easier to remove. Some of the 
            chemicals used are bentonite (powdered clay), isinglass (fish bladder), casein (milk protein) gelatin, or 
            egg whites.  The entire purpose of this is to soften a wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Finish</dt>
        <dd>
            Drinking wine isn't as simple as just quenching your thirst as you and your
            Roman buddies recover from burning a village full of Goths.  Nowadays 
            we also talk about what our body experiences AFTER we have swallowed the wine, 
            the "finish". Does it make us want to drink more? Obviously.  But does it taste
            like we licked a chalkboard (riesling) or maybe we get hints of Christmas? That's the finish.
        </dd>
    <dt>Free-Run Juice</dt>
        <dd>
            When all the grapes are collected into a container, the weight of the grapes begins to crush the ones below 
            them and that juice is the "Free-Run" juice. In white wines, this is the most desirable juice because it had
            the least contact with the skins, seeds, and stems of the grapes.
        </dd>
    <dt>Fruit Forward</dt>
        <dd>
            The wine-nerd term for wines with fruits as the dominant flavor. Again, all wine is
            made with fruit, but fruit-forward wines sometimes come across as "sweet"
        </dd>
    <dt>Grape</dt>
        <dd>A thin-skinned bag of water and seeds that makes an almost spiritual beverage
            that servers across the world ar asked to sell
        </dd>
    <dt>Hang Time</dt>
        <dd>
            Just like how "hang time" means how long Tony Hawk is in the air during one of his skateboarding tricks, 
            phrase is used to describe how long the grapes hang on the vine and ripen. Longer hang time = more sugar.
        </dd>
    <dt>Hectare</dt>
        <dd>
            How the Europeans measure the size of their vineyards.  One hectare is equivalent to 10,000 sq meters or 
            2.47 acres.
        </dd>
    <dt>Ice Wine</dt>
        <dd>
            Not a frozen wine, or wine with ice in it. It's actually grapes that have been frozen so they end up having 
            more concentrated sugar content and thus produce sweeter dessert wines.
        </dd>
    <dt>Inoculation</dt>
        <dd>
            When the winemaker adds yeast to the grape juice to jumpstart fermentation.
        </dd>
    <dt>Lactic Acid</dt>
        <dd>
            A smooth acid created during malolactic fermentation in wine and is also found in milk.
        </dd>
    <dt>Lees</dt>
        <dd>
            The fat dead bodies of the yeast monsters that gorged themselves on the sugar in the 
            grape juice. After they eat themselves to death, the dead yeast sinks to the bottom 
            of the fermenting container (barrel or bottle) and becomes either *gross lees* which are 
            the dead bodies as well as skins, stems, and seeds or *fine lees* where it's just their 
            dead bodies.  If a wine ages for a long time in contact with fine lees, it devlopes round, 
            creamy flavors.
        </dd>
    <dt>Legs</dt>
        <dd>
            You know when wine-nerds swirl their glass and look at it? That's them looking at the legs of the wine, or 
            the way the wine sticks to the sides of the glass and trails down. Longer legs = more alcohol and higher 
            body.
        </dd>
    <dt>Length</dt>
        <dd>
            This is the total amount of time it takes for you to enjoy a sip of wine. Really what you're talking about 
            is how long the wine taste and feel persists in your mouth after you swallowed.  The finish. Most common 
            ways to describe length are "short", "long", and "lingering".  The longer the finish, the higher quality the 
            wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Loam</dt>
        <dd>
            Soil containg a mix of clay, silt, and sand.
        </dd>
    <dt>Malic Acid</dt>
        <dd>
            A sharp, tart acid found in both grapes and green apples.  This is the starting acid that turns into the 
            softer lactic acid through Malolactic Fermentation. Grapes grown in cooler climates contain high levels of 
            malic acid and thus produce wines that have aromas and flavors of green apples.
        </dd>
    <dt>Malolactic Fermentation</dt>
        <dd>
            Natural bacterial conversion that turn sharp and tart malic acid into the softer and creamier lactic acid. 
            Most red wines go through Malolactic Fermentation, but it's most closely associated with Chardonnays. This 
            produces a rich, creamy, and buttery version of white wines.
        </dd>
    <dt>Meniscus</dt>
        <dd>
            The thin rim of where the wine edge meets the glass. This is used a lot when describing the hue of the wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Meritage</dt>
        <dd>
            A completely made up term, this is American for French. I mean really, it's the combination of "merit" and 
            "heritage" and we use it to describe Bourdeaux-style red wines that are made in California.
        </dd>
    <dt>Método Tradicional</dt>
        <dd>
            The traditional way of making Champagne (or Cava) where the second fermentation,
            the fermentation that makes the bubbles in sparkling wine, takes place inside the
            bottle itself. The bottle is held upside down and the lees settle in the neck. The neck is then frozen so 
            the CO<sub>2</sub> pushes the frozen plug out.  Lastly, a solution of wine and sugar is placed back in and 
            that's what gives the sweetness to the wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Mouthfeel</dt>
        <dd>
            No really, it's what it sounds like . . . how the wine feels in your mouth. Most of the time we use words 
            that describe the texture of the wine (smooth, silky, velvety, rough). Mouthfeel is a combination of the 
            different components of the wine: acidity can be sharp, alcohol can be hot, tannins can be rough, and sugar 
            can be thick or cloying.
        </dd>
    <dt>Must</dt>
        <dd>
            You *must* have *must* to make wine. I am hilarious.  Really though, must is
            just the juice that's pressed from the grapes before it's fermented. In 
            red and rosé wines, this includes the stems, skins, and seeds of the grapes.
        </dd>
    <dt>New World</dt>
        <dd>
            This means the same thing that it meant after Columbus and the others "discovered" America.  New World is 
            the phrase we use for countries that aren't Europe and have started producing wines.
        </dd>
    <dt>Notes</dt>
        <dd>
            As in, this wine has "notes" of . . . it's the word we use when we're just not so 
            sure we actually tasted or smelled something. I think I taste cherries, but maybe that's
            berries?  So we'll say it has notes of cherries.
        </dd>
    <dt>Old Vine</dt>
        <dd>
            Vines that are 50 + years old.  These older vines produce smaller quantities of grapes which are then much 
            more concentrated in flavor.
        </dd>
    <dt>Old World</dt>
        <dd>
            Countries in Europe that have been making wine since the Romans conquered them. 
        </dd>
    <dt>Oxygen</dt>
        <dd>It's part of the stuff you breathe. Do I really have to explain what Oxygen is?
            Ok fine, for the sake of this website it's a molecule that really changes the flavor of wine
        </dd>
    <dt>Palate</dt>
        <dd>Most of the your life, palate is the word for the roof of your mouth that you stab
            with crisp pizza crusts and hurts like the bejeezus afterwards. But in wine, the palate
            encompasses all the flavors that you taste when you're appreciating wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>pH</dt>
        <dd>
            Not just how you choose your deoderant, this is how we measure chemically how acidic (or basic)
            a beverage is, on a scale of 0 to 14. The neutral point is 7, and that's pure H<sub>2</sub>O whereas 
            0 is battery acid and 14 is drain cleaner.
        </dd>
    <dt>Phenolics</dt>
        <dd>
            Tannins, color pigments, and flavor compounds originating in the skins, seeds, and stems of grapes. These 
            antioxidants are more prevalent in red wines than white wines.
        </dd>
    <dt>Pip</dt>
        <dd>
            High Maka Maka for grape seed.
        </dd>
    <dt>Pump-Over</dt>
        <dd>
            AKA *remontage*, this is the process of pumping red wine from the bottom of the tank and splashing it over 
            the cap of the fermenting must in order to submerge the skins and force the CO<sub>2</sub> to the surface, 
            thus releasing it.
        </dd>
    <dt>Punch-Down</dt>
        <dd>
            AKA *pigéage*, this is the process of breaking up the big mass of floating junk at the top of a red wine 
            juice while it is fermenting.  This re-submerges the skins, stems, and seeds which allows for more 
            extraction of the color, tannins, flavor, and aromas from the grape solids.
        </dd>
    <dt>Punt</dt>
        <dd>
            You know that indention in the bottom of a wine bottle?  Make you feel really fancy when you use that to 
            pour the wine at your tables? Yeah, that's the punt. Originally this was used to strengthen the bottles when 
            they were handblown, but now it's just for show in everything except sparkling wines. This indention allows
            the bottle to withstand the extra pressure created from holding in the bubbles.
        </dd>
    <dt>Racking</dt>
        <dd>
            This is the process where winemakers will siphon wine out from its first fermenting container and move it to 
            another container, just without the *Gross Lees*.  This also introduces oxygen to the wine juice which allows 
            it to get rid of unwanted reductive aromas.
        </dd>
    <dt>Reductive Wine</dt>
        <dd>This is a way of making wine where the winemaker focuses on making sure
            as little oxygen as possible gets to the wine.  Oxygen really changes the
            end result, so this method preserves as much of the original character of the
            wine as possible.
        </dd>
    <dt>Residual Sugar</dt>
        <dd>
            Once the yeast is done eating all the sugar it can, this is what's left over in the wine. 
            Residual Sugar is the only way a wine is actually "sweet" because without RS, what people are 
            tasting is a "fruit-forward" wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Riddling</dt>
        <dd>
            Madam Clicquot (of Veuve Clicquot) developed this part of the *méthode traditionelle* where the second 
            fermentation for sparkling wines happens with the bottles in a horizontal position so the lees/sediment rest 
            on the side of the bottles.  The bottles are then turned a quarter of a turn every day and gradually tilted 
            upside-down so the lees work their way into the bottle's neck.
        </dd>
    <dt>Sur Lie</dt>
        <dd>
            The French term for when wine ages while sitting in contact with the fine lees at the bottom of 
            the container. This adds body and creamier flavors like warm brioche. *Sur lie* aging adds texture, 
            complexity, and depth.
        </dd>
    <dt>Tannin</dt>
        <dd>
            Even though tannins have nothing to do with how "dry" a wine is (that's about sweetness),
            tannins literally dry your mouth out. It's that tongue-cleaning sensation that comes with drinking
            unsweetened tea.  Tannins add structure to a wine.
        </dd>
    <dt>Tech Sheet</dt>
        <dd>
            A sheet some producers will put out describing their wines.  It will include a whole
            bunch of information every server everywhere ignores.  
        </dd>
    <dt>Terroir</dt>
        <dd>
            One of those wine-nerd terms that terrifies people (get it, terror?), terroir is an old term (started with the Greeks) 
            that means "a sense of place" essentially. It's how all the different aspects of the world affect the grapes 
            used to make the wine.  The soil, the climate, the location, etc.
        </dd>
    <dt>Vintage</dt>
        <dd>
            The year the wine was made. Wines made without a specific year are called NV or Nonvintage.
        </dd>
    <dt>Warm Climate</dt>
        <dd>Warm Climate regions have much more consistent timperatures that don't cvary
            as much as the cooler climates do. This leads to a long slow slide into fall
            which lets the grapes get a lot riper. Warm climates include: California, Argentina,
            Australia, Southern Italy, South Africa, Southern France.  Wines from warmer 
            climates ten to be more full-bodied, bolder, softer acidity, and a high ABV.
        </dd>
    <dt>Whole-cluster Fermentation</dt>
        <dd>
            It means what it sounds like . . . the winemakers take the entire cluster of grapes 
            off the branch and then smashes them with the stems and all, and then lets them ferment 
            with the whole cluster still in the juice. Including the stem adds more tannins and thus structure 
            to the wine. Early-picked clusters impart vegetal and herbal flavors whereas long-hanging clusters 
            have stems that have turned rigid and brown and impart more mellow, earthy, and spicy flavors.
