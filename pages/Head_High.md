## Provenance
### Winery
* Head High Pinot Noir comes from pure, unadulterated Sonoma County fruit - this is the highest quality pinot noir at the best price. Wine grower Bill Price grew up in Hawaii where surfing became a lifelong passion of his, before returning to California and falling in love with wine. Head High wines are just like head high waves: pure, unadulterated, and ready to go.

### Winemaking 
**Vintage Notes** → We saw a long, cool growing season in 2019, allowing the fruit to have extended hang time, which just like hang time on the waves, gives a sense of equilibrium and balance. 2019 shines as the year of true-to-form pinot noir
