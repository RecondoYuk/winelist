## Provenance
### Winery
**Mönchhof** means “The Monks House” or “Monks Court”
The Monchhof estate is mentioned first as belonging to the Cistercian abbey of Himmerod in the Eifel in 1177. After the Secularisation undre Napoleon the family Eymael bought the estate on an auction in Paris in 1804 from the French state
### Region
**Mosel, Germany**
The wine was grown in the steep slopes around Urzig and Erden. At steep slopes our team hand-picked the grapes. The blue soil charges the sun heat during the day-time and passes it to the vine during the cooler night-time. The grapes were directly pressed after the arrival at the estate.
- **Vineyards**
	- The Ürziger Würzgarten
		- Planted on volcanic soil in combination with red slate soil (rhyolithe)
		- The Würzgarten (means “Spicy Garden”) surrounds the Mönchhof Estate
		- Some vines are 120 years old
			- Produce loose hanging, smaller berries that are intense in taste
			- Ideal for intense late harvest wines
	- The Erderner Treppchen
		- Planted on mostly blue slate soil]
		- ‘“Treppchen” means “Little Staircase”
			- So steep that it is difficult to work in the hill
			- Locals named the site after the stairs that workers built into the vineyard to make their life easier hundreds of years ago
		- Cooler than the Würzgarten
			- due to its slightly more western exposition
