<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<p>Joel Gott is a fourth-generation California vintner, and wine and food entrepreneur. Maxing out his credit cards, Joel purchased several tons of Amador County Zinfandel from a family friend and grape grower in 1996. He made the wine with the help of his then-girlfriend and winemaker Sarah, whom he married the following year. Praised by the Wine Spectator, the Wine Advocate, and the New York Times, Zinfandel helped put Joel Gott Wines on the map, and gave Joel the chance to produce additional varietals.</p>

<h3 id="region">Region</h3>
<p><strong>Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake County, Lodi</strong></p>

<p>To make a well-balanced red wine, we blended Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petite Sirah, Alicante, and Malbec from five different appellations in California. Fruit from Napa Valley lends complexity while Sonoma adds a touch of spice to the blend. Mendocino fruit gives the wine its color, rich, ripe fruit flavors and tannins. Lake County adds structured tannins and minerality while fruit from Lodi rounds out the blend adding rich flavors and soft texture.</p>

  <li><strong>Harvest Notes</strong> â†’ Across California in 2017, the growing season started with much needed winter rains, resulting in a later than usual bud break. Warm spring and summer temperatures, followed by a late summer heat wave, caused us to pick our fruit in the beginning of September.</li>
  <li><strong>Winemaking Notes</strong> â†’ After fermentation, the wine was aged in 1 &amp; 2-year-old American oak to complement the flavors and tannins of the wine and soften the mid-palate.</li>

<h3 id="tasting-notes">Tasting Notes</h3>
<p>The Joel Gott 2017 Palisades red wine has aromas of red cherries, chocolate, leather, cherry compote, baking spices and notes of toasted oak. On the palate, bright red fruit flavors lead to smooth tannins and subtle acidity on the mid-palate with notes of vanilla on the long, delicate finish.</p>
