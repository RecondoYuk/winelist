### Region
**South Australia**

 - Padthaway, Wrattonbully, Coonawarra, McLaren Vale
    - The South-East growing districts of South Australia enjoyed above average winter rainfall, while McLaren Vale recorded well below average. September temperatures were cool with little rainfall, resulting in some isolated frost events. Summer was generally hot, with high temperatures delaying véraison. Irrigation was crucial to keep vines in good health. The proximity of the Southern Ocean played an important role in moderating temperatures allowing for a high quality harvest, albeit with smaller yields than average.

### Winemaking 
Above-average winter and spring rainfall offered the vines across South Australia healthy soil moisture profiles for the growing season. Cool days and cooler nights slowed vine growth in early spring with temperatures warming in October. Late flowering and veraison delayed harvest by a few weeks. Weather conditions during ripening were generally dry with conditions favoring fully ripened grapes with well-developed colors and flavors.

## Wine
### Grapes
100% Cabernet Sauvignon

### Tasting Notes
Classically varietal rhubarb vibrancy and flavor profile, with earthy freshly grated beetroot, cranberry sweetness, and lush summer pudding. Powdery tannins combining with (oak derived) creamy cashews and walnuts give a felt-like texture/mouthfeel.

### Profile
 - **See** →  Dark Red with Crimson hues
 - **Smell** → Spices, spices, spices! No question they are the hero element in this vintage. A swirl releases an aromatic kaleidoscope of cumin, fresh clove, paprika, and cardamom. Aromas of roasted spring vegetables in olive oil, with lamb and rosemary round out the offer.
     - Enticing aromatics, with exotic fruits of the forest leaping from the glass. Raspberry, black cherry, olive tapenade, and oolong tea are framed by a  subtle char toast character.  Hints of sea spray and a distinct Campari note linger
 - **Sip** → Cranberry represents the red fruit spectrum, with lingering flavors of yellow plum, bay leaf, and sage. Root vegetable earthiness is evident on the finish.
 - **Savor** → Taut in texture, fine tannin with a savory profile.
 - **Body** → Structurally framed by beautifully integrated French and American oak, present but rarely mentioned.
