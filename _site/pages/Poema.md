## Provenance
### Winery 
A small-production, quality-oriented Spanish wine producer crafting top value Cava. Poema owns 20% of the vineyard sources’ the rest are under long-term contract with growers who follow strict quality specifications. Fruit is sustainably farmed, using organic fertilizer and no herbicides.

### Region
**Spain / Penedès**
- Sourced from 152 hectacres of vineyards located between the high, central, and low regions of the Penedès valley in the Catalan province of Barcelona with each region best suited for specific varietals.
* The Penedès valley’s three regions offer perfect terroirs for growing the trio of indigenous grapes used to craft traditional Cava.
	* The High Penedès (over 500 meters above sea level) is hilly with a chalky soil, ideal for the Paralleada grape
	* Low and Central (up to 500 meters above sea level) Penedès’s limestone and clay soils are excellent matches for the Macabeo and Xarel-lo grapes.
### Winemaking 
**What is Cava**→ Spain adopted the word, *cava* which technically means ‘cellar’ in Catalan, to describe their sparkling wines made using the traditional method. While this style was first created outside of Spain in the 1600s, its birthplace inside of Spain came in 1872 when Jose Raventós of Cordoníu first produced traditional method sparkling wine in the town of San Sadurní d’Anoia. Uniquely, the Cava denomination isn’t restricted to one geographical area but rather it spans eight total wine regions.

Poema carefully observes the Cava DO’s stringent regulations to craft its top-quality, small-production Cavas, which are made using the same traditional method used in Champagne. The grapes are grown in the limestone hills surrounding Barcelona on vines that are a minimum of 20 years old. A green harvest and careful selection help to ensure that only ripe, pristine grapes are picked. Grapes are harvested manually and pressed in three different wineries close to the vineyards before each lot is fermented separately. With 55% of the must free-run juice, the grapes are fermented in stainless steel tanks, then the lots are blended and second fermentation takes place in the bottle according to Método Tradicional (the second fermentation that makes the bubbles takes place inside the bottle). Residual sugar is 5 g/l.

## Wine
### Grapes
40% Macabeo, 40% Xarel-lo, 20% Parellada
* Macabeo (aka Viura) lends pleasant aromatics to the blend
* Parellada adds acidity and finesse
* Xarel-lo is the grape that gives body, earth, and greengage characteristics to Cava

### Tasting Notes
Fresh, clean, citrus, mineral, and Granny Smith apple aromas with toasted bread notes make this a great example of cava

Vibrant aromas of ripe peaches, pears, and toasted bread with a hint of spice fill the nose. The palate is dry with a rich, creamy texture. Layers of flavor include orange rind and spice that persists through an elegant finish.
