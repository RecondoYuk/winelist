# Welcome to the Wine List!

Dukes Beachhouse Maui just revamped our winelist, so I decided to put together a website full of all the information I or my teammates could possibly need to sell the new wines. It's not pretty, but I'm not a designer, so take it with a grain of salt.

Also, I have a lot of information in here so here are ways to bypass all the information:

## By the Guest's Preference
So your guests says "I want a . . . " 

The list on [this page](Wines_By_Guest.html) walks you through some simple requests you're likely to come across.

## By the wine's Component
So you have a guest that wants a dryer wine, or maybe they want the wine with the highest or lowest alcohol, or other aspects of the wines.
