<p>Rombauer Vineyards began producing Chardonnay in 1982. In 1990, the Rombauer family made their first Chardonnay from the Carneros region, where San Pablo Bay meets the southern end of Napa and Sonoma valleys. There, the cool climate and clay soils offer ideal conditions for growing superiors Chardonnay with the Rombauer hallmarks of intense fruit flavors balanced by fresh acidity.</p>

<p><strong>Story/History</strong> → Founded in 1980, by Koerner and Joan Rombauer, Rombauer Vineyards has been producing acclaimed wines from Napa Valley and the Sierra Foothills ever since. Still family owned and operated, their winery is known for its high-quality wines, exceptional vineyard sites, and family-style hospitality. “Joy of Wine” on every cork is an homage to the <em>Joy of Cooking</em>, America’s first and top selling cookbook written by Irma Rombauer (Koerner’s great aunt). This wine spends 9 months in American and French oak barrels (1/3rd new)</p>

<p>The grapes were gently whole-cluster pressed while the fruit was still cool. The juice was pumped to tank to cold-settle overnight before it was racked to barrel for primary and malolactic fermentation. The lees were stirred every two weeks to give the wine rich flavors and a creamy texture.</p>

<p><strong>Winegrowing</strong> → Good rains in February lead to a warm summer, which then turned cool in August, resulting in a later harvest than the last few years. What followed was a long warm fall with near perfect growing conditions and extended hang time. In the end it was one of the longest harvests on record and also above average crop size. Sustainable farming practices throughoutt the growing season were tailored to each block with the assistance of aerial photos produced using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) technology. The fruit was hand-picked and sorted in the vineyard.</p>

<p>Pale yellow with a green tinge to the hue. Aromas of yellow peach, mango with a slight citrus note intertwine seamlessly with vanilla and spice. The palate is rich and round, with the mango and vanilla fighting for the lime light, while the cream texture, vanilla, and slight butter combine seamlessly.</p>
