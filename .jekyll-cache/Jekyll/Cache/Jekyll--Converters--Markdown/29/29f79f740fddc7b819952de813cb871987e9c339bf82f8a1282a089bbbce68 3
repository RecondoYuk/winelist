<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<p>One of California‚Äôs first female winemakers, Merry Edwards began her career at Mount Eden Vineyards in the Santa Cruz Mountains in 1974. She went on to become the founding winemaker at Matanzas Creek in 1977 and remained there until 1984. For the next decade, Merry consulted for numerous wineries, large and small, in Oregon and California. In 1997, family and friends joined Merry to found Merry Edwards Winery, with a focus on producing Pinot Noirs with a sense of place from Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast</p>

<h3 id="region">Region</h3>
<p><strong>Russian River Valley, California</strong></p>

<p>The Russian River Valley is an ideal spot to grow Sauvignon Blanc. Warm days and cool nights allow the grapes to hold onto their natural acidity. While 2019 was our last wet growing season, with three ‚Äúatmospheric rivers‚Äù in May, it did not affect the Sauvignon Blanc flowering or set. It did produce very vigorous vine growth, which led us to be proactive with our canopy management in order to get the ripe tropical flavors we aim for in our Sauvignon Blanc.</p>

<h3 id="tasting-notes">Tasting Notes</h3>
<p>Abundant aromas of tropical fruit leap from the glass, white pineapple, ripe passionfruit, mango and guava, and a hint of banana cream pie. The palate is round and open, with accents of ruby red grapefruit, honeysuckle, and melon married with a burst of crisp, refreshing acidity.</p>
