<p>Morgan Twain-Peterson literally grew up in a winery. His father, Joel Peterson, started Ravenswood and helped to make Zinfandel famous in CA. Years later Morgan started Bedrock and devoted himself to saving some of the oldest vineyards in the state. This bottling is a blend of fruit from ‘ancient vines’, some of which are over 100 years old and averaging over 80 years old! The drawing on the label is of an old, gnarly Zinfandel vine. There is a small raven on one of the limbs as a tribute to his dad. These old vineyards were often planted as ‘field blends’ with several different grape varieties mixed within the same row.</p>

<p><strong>Sonoma County, California</strong>
Though its core still revolves around the Sonoma Valley appellation (Bedrock Vineyard, Monte Rosso, and Casa Santinamaria Vineyard), we have become geographically more adventurous due to the addition of a few pretty amazing vineyards. The first of these is Nervo Ranch in Alexander Valley with its steep, decomposed shale soils. The second is Sodini Ranch on Limerick Lane in the Russian River Valley that Bedrock Wine Co happily farms. The last is the amazing Stampede Vineyard in the Clements Hills AVA of Lodi: own-rooted on granitic sands and planted in 1919, it is a star in the making under the new ownership of the Perlegos family. There are also bits of Papera Ranch, Pagani Ranch, and Lorenzo’s in the blend.</p>

<p>The 2018 Zinfadel Old Vine is bright, floral, and beautifully perfumed. Crushed red berries, flowers and sweet spice give the 2018 a very pretty sense of lift. In 2018 the Old Vine is especially gracious and light on its feet. The blend incorporates fruit from a number of top sites including Bedrock, Teldeschi, Esola, Pagani, Papera, Evangelho, and Pato.</p>
