## Provenance
### Winery
 - Domaine Carneros is best known as a small grower-producer of méthode traditionelle sparkling wine, Pinot Noir, estate vineyards, and a breathtakingly beautiful Château.
 - Founded in 1987
     - Claude Taittinger selected a 138-acre parcel in the heart of Carneros, Napa Valley
     - Claude chose Eileen Crane to oversee the winery
     - She retired in 2020 and passed the torch to new CEO Remi Cohen
         - carries on the tradition of visionary female leadership

### Region
**Carneros, California**
 - Considered (just like Champagne France) to be a *Region 1*
	- This is the coolest of the five designated regions
	- Grapes are harvested in the cool of the night to ensure minimal bitterness and tannin in the resulting juice.

### Winemaking 
**Harvest Notes** → In 2017, Carneros was gifted with its 3rd wettest winter in 125 years, refilling reservoirs and aquifers that had been depleted in the previous drought years. Happy vines developed healthy canopies which tempered the higher-than-average temperatures and brief heat spikes that characterized the growing season. Harvest began on August 7th, a fairly typical start date in Carneros. The resulting wines show beautiful depth, concentration, and freshness.

### Tasting Notes
Richness and complexity begin on the nose, with bounding aromas of lemon zest, green apples, toasted almonds, and macadamia nut. The palate is round and full, revealing poached pear, crisp apple, yuzu, honeydew melon, and pie crust with a toasty finish that lingers on the palate, begging for another sip. This winery exclusive has been aged to perfection yet will enjoy additional evolution in the cellar over the next decade.

### Points of Distinction
Our Estate Brut is the signature wine of Domaine Carneros. It encompasses an array of clones and blocks from our estate vineyards. The tapestry of flavors that result, married with the inherent finesse of the cool Carneros fruit, create wines of depth and complexity that are enhanced by a minimum of three years of bottle age *sur lie* in the cellar before release. This extra bottle age yields a complex, toasty aroma and fine pinpoint bubbles.

### Food Pairing
We recommend pairing our 2017 Estate Brut with triple cream or goat cheeses. Perfect with a just a few toasted nuts, it will also enhance simple to complex meals. Oysters and shellfish dishes work well, and we suggest trying it with Asian Cuisine.
