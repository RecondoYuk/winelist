# Acidity
This is the mouth-watering factor of wine that drives how refreshing the wine is, and acidity is a large component of the *structure* of the wine.

Acidity acts as a stabilizer and cleanses the palate.  Acidity decreases Body.

As grapes ripen and accumulate sugar, their acidity begins to fall and their pH begins to rise.  The longer the grapes hang on the vine, the lower the acidity of the juice that will come from those grapes.

### Key Points
A key point to remember is that ***Hot Climates Produce Less Acidic Wines***  
The most acidic White Wines tend to be the Sauvignon Blancs, the Rieslings, and the Champagnes.  The acidity in these wines balance out the the sweetness in those wines.   
The least acidic of White Wines tend to Chardonnay’s and Rosés.

The wine should be more acidic than the food when pairing.

The most acidic of the Red Wines tend to be Cabernets, Syrahs, and Pinot Noirs, whereas the least acidic tend to be the Zinfandels.

Acids are generally sour rather than bitter.

### pH Balance
All wines are acidic, most with a pH balance between 3 and 4.  Higher acid wines have a much lower pH number and can taste as sour as a lemon when their pH is down around 2.6, almost punishingly acidic.  Lower acid wines sometimes taste as flat as Greek yogurt and have a pH up around 4.5, and these taste barely tart.

According to 2017 study found at [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808596/), 93% of the 380 beverages they purchased from stores in Birmingham, Alabama had a pH below 4.0.  



#### But WTF is pH?
pH is a measure of how acidic/alkalinity (basic) a substance is.  The full range is from a pH of 0 (Battery Acid) to a pH of 14 (Drain Cleaner).  Neither of those sound like a good idea for a beverage. 

The neutral point is 7, and human blood (at least according to USGS.gov) is at 7.4.  Still not really a drinkable option (unless you’re a character on What We Do in the Shadows).  People on an alkaline diet are trying to aim for that 7.4 pH in everything.

**10x the next level** — For each number away the next, as in 4 below 5, the acidity or alkalinity of the substance is 10x different from the one next to it is.  So in our chart below, Kombucha is 10x more acidic than Apple Juice,  and water is 10x more basic (alkaline) than non-dairy milks.

**Warning** Enamel begins to dissolve at a pH of 5.50

### Types of Acid
There are different types of acidity.

In wine, a lot of the acidity has to do with the climate that the grapes are grown in.  
**Cooler Climates** produce grapes with higher acidity and lower sugar levels.

**Warmer Climates** produce grapes with lower acidity levels and higher sugar levels.

#### Citric Acid
**Tingly**
Naturally occurring substance in citrus drinks, it imparts a tangy flavor and acts as a preservative.

#### Phosphoric Acid
Added to cola drinks to impart tartness and improve shelf-life.

#### Tartaric Acid
**Tart**
Found in bananas
Can be added to wines during acidification to increase the final acidity of the wine.

#### Malic Acid
**Fruity**
Occurs naturally in apples, pears, and cherries and is added to many non-carbonated beverages such as fruit drinks, fortified juices, sports drinks, and iced teas because it enhances the intrinsic flavor.

#### Lactic Acid
**Soft and Round**
Occurs naturally in milk but not found naturally in grapes.  It’s created during the winemaking process.  Lactic acid bacteria eats the tart magic acid compounds and converts them to softer lactic acid through ***malolactic fermentation***

### Chaptalization / Acidification
#### Chaptalization
This is the process of adding sugar to the unfermented grape must (the fermenting juice) in order to increase the alcohol content after fermentation.   This isn’t so much to make the wine sweeter as much to provide more sugar to the yeast to ferment into alcohol in the case that the wine grapes were too sour/acidic when harvested.

The Romans had been doing this for centuries by adding honey as a sweetening agent and to add a sense of body / mouthfeel to their wines, but the first modern instance was in 1777 when French chemist *Pierre Macquer* discovered that the actual chemical benefit to adding sugar to the wine must was an increase in alcohol to balance the high acidity of underripe grapes.  

A few years later, Napoleon’s Minister of the Interior, French chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal developed the technique and pushed it was a way to preserve wines longer for Napoleon’s soldiers.  This worked for a while, but in 1907 almost a million protestors demonstrated violently against chaptalization because it threatened their jobs so the French government began regulating it.

Chaptalization is common in cooler regions because the grapes sometimes struggle to reach ripeness, and thus need to have added sugar content to balance the acidity.

#### Acidification
This is where the winemaker adds some acid to make up for grapes that were too ripe when they were harvested.  This tends to produce wines with a low acidity that will have off-flavors and deteriorate quickly.  
 
Usually the winemaker is going to add **tartaric** or **malic** acid.   Some winemakers will lower the acidity through **cold stabilization** or by adding **potassium bicarbonate** or **potassium bitartrate**.

Acidification is commonly used in hotter regions such as Argentina, California, Washington State, Italy, and South Africa.

Wines that have added acidity will often have a candy-like flavor in them that persists in the aftertaste, like Dr Pepper.  

### Tasting
Acidity is one of the 4 major taste  categories that our tongue can taste.  The others are Bitterness, Saltiness, and sweetness.  Acids provide a tartness and tangy taste that helps balance the sweetness and sugar present in the beverage.

When tasting acidity, the least acidic tastes tend to be closer to milk whereas the more acidic are closer to lemon juice and lemonades.

This is perceived as mouthwatering, back-of-jaw puckering.  High-acid wines taste “tart” or “zippy” whereas low-acid wines taste smoother and creamier.

### Describing Acidity
#### Describing Low-Acid Wines
“This wine is creamy with soft acidity” or “Like taking a gulp of a glass of whole milk.”  

#### Describing High-Acid Wines
“This wine has mouthwatering acidity” or “Makes your mouth salivate” or “Like biting into a freshly picked lemon.”

# Oak
![Oaky Afterbirth](6_Wine_Attributes/oaky_afterbirth.png)

### Key Points
Wines can be oaked or unoaked.   Oaking adds body. 

Why Oak? I mean wine was expanded throughout the world through the Roman soldiers and they used clay amphorae to transport it so how did oak get added?

Have you ever gone camping? Ever tried to take something fragile or precious with you?  Yeah, that shit breaks.  Same thing with the clay amphorae filled with wine that the Romans took with them.  The further they travelled, the harder it was to keep from breaking things.  It was like carrying your wine around in flower vases.

When they got to Europe, they discovered that the Gauls were using oak barrels to transport beer. 

Now the thing about oak is that it has a really tight grain to its wood that makes it a naturally waterproof(ish) wood to carry things in, especially after just a bit of toasting.  The second thing about oak is that there’s a shitload of it in Europe.  The transition from transporting in amphorae to transporting in barrels was complete in the entire western world within the next two centuries. 

The thing is, that they discovered oak didn’t just make it easy to transport wine, it actually added pleasant flavors to the wine itself.

#### Affects of Oak
The longer a white wine sits in oak, the darker of a yellow the wine becomes.  This adds a creamier and softer mouthfeel to the wine. 

Oak is a natural antiseptic so wine that is fermented or matured in oak barrels needs less sulphur dioxide.

Oak smoothes the wine tannins, improves wine age-ability, texture, and stabilizes color in red wines.

#### Ways to Add Oak
- Oak in the container
- Oak chips, staves, cubes
	- Cost much less than barrels
	- can be added during fermentation as a substitute
	- Words like “Oak maturation” and “Oak influence” on the label point to the use of chips or staves
- Oak essences or oak extract
	- It is illegal in many countries
	- *Oenological tannins* are extractions from oak, chestnut, or birch wood, grape seeds, or other plant resources
		- If the wine tastes the same every year this is the most likely cause
#### Types of Oak
While some winemakers use other woods like Chestnut or Acacia, most wood used to add oak to wines tend to be either French oak (*Quercus robur*) or American white oak (*Quercus alba*).  

- **American**Ideal for bolder wines
	- The species used for oaking wine is American White Oak (*Quercus alba*), found throughout the Eastern US and is commonly found in Missouri.
	- Imparts a lot of flavors
		- adds ruggedness to clean, fruit-forward new world wines
		- notes of intense vanilla, roasted coffee, toast, wood sugars, and coconut
	- About half of an American oak tree can be used to make barrels (as opposed to the French oak only having a quarter of it utilized for making barrels).
		- Can be cut using a machine
- **French**European oak tends to be denser (closer spaced rings) which in theory imparts less oak lactones and oxygen than American oak.
		- Highest tannin content of all oak types
	- Tends to add flavor in a more subtle way
		- aromatic sweetness
		- subtle flavors of cinnamon, chocolate, and créme brûlée, spice and satin-like tannins
	- Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are ideal for French oak
	- Only a quarter of the French oak tree can be used to make barrels because of the way it is cut
		- The porous wood demands hand splitting
- **Hungarian / Eastern European** Same as the French oak (*Quercus robur*)
	- Remarkably similar to French oak but much less expensive
		- Still moderately expensive due to the low yields
	- Successful with full-bodied varieties like Malbec and Petite Verdot
		- The “hold up” to the richer, nutty flavors the wood imparts
	- Less tannin than French oak
- **New** 
	- “New oak is a sign that the winemaker wants to produce a serious wine”
		- New oak barrels are extremely expensive
			- It takes an entire tree to produce 2 barrels
			- The tree needs to be at least 80 years old
			- takes 10-36 months to prepare the barrel
	- As new oak influence increases, you begin to taste subtle baking spices, grilled nuts, and vanilla
	- Old barrels and casks do not add perceptible flavors to the wine after about 3 years of use
- **Toasted**
	- The level of toasting of the inside of the barrels determines the flavors imparted into the wine
		- More toast gives richer flavors of spice, vanilla, and coffee bean
	- Give off smoky and caramel flavors to the wines
	- 5 levels of toast according to [World Cooperage](https://www.worldcooperage.com)
		- Light Toasting
			- Enhanced structure and subtle notes of toast
		- Medium Toasting
			- Soft caramel notes accented by toasted bread
		- Medium-long Toasting
			- Results in a wine with supple tannins and accentuated fruit complexity
		- Medium-plus Toasting
			- Sweet cream with notes of vanilla and brown sugar
		- Heavy toasting
			- Rich mocha character and accentuates darker fruits in the wine

#### Oak Barrels
- What is a Barrel?
	- The head
		- Round ends which form the top and bottom of the barrels
	- The staves
		- The strips of wood that form the sides of the barrel
	- The hoops
		- The metal parts that hold the staves together
		- Made by a Cooper and where a lot of the cost of the barrels comes from
	- The bunghole
		- The hole used to fill and empty the barrels
	- The bung
		- The plug for the bunghole.  This used to always be wood but now is also silicone or other materials, whatever it takes to plug the hole.
- Two Standard Sizes became popular because when empty they could be easily moved by one person for cleaning / repositioning.
	- 225 Liter / 59 Gallon Barrels
		- Also called *barrique bordeleaise*
			- Bordeaux Barriques
	- 228 Liter / 60 Gallon Barrels
		- Burgundy Style Barrels
- Hogsheads
	- 300 Liter / 79 Gallons
		- Larger format barrels retain delicate aromatics and verve while still allowing the texture to evolve
- Puncheons
	- 500 Liter / 132 Gallons
- Italian Style Botti
	- Equivalent to about 11 of the smaller barrels and can hold about 275 cases of wine
	- They last much longer than the smaller barrels (some to over 50 years)

### Tasting Oak
Oak barrels, especially new oak, impart more flavors to the wine although they vary according to the degree of toasting and the type of oak used.

Wines that are unoaked tend to be fresh, fruity and somewhat floral.
The oakiest wines you can taste chocolate and caramel. 

Since the majority of red wine is produced using some oak, people don’t recognize its influence.  Overoaked red tend to taste and smell too woody or astringent.   There’s a clear difference between white wines made with oak influence and without.

#### Oak Adds Aroma Compounds
- Oak *lactones* have coconut aromas
- Vanillan
	- The aroma of Vanilla

# Tannin
### Key Points
Tannin provides structure to both Red and White wines, although it’s most obvious in red wines as they are invariably fermented win contact with the skins, seeds and sometimes stems that provide the most tannins.

Tannin comes from naturally occurring polyphenols in skins, seeds, and stems, as well as from the wood barrels that wines are stored in. 

Tannin helps stabilize the wine and acts as a buffer against oxidation which means the wine will age better. 

Tannin also provides antioxidants that have health benefits.

**Dry** is not the word to describe tannin because that’s the descriptive word in wines for the level of sweetness in the wine.

####  Two Types of Tannin
- **Wood tannins** / **Oak Aging**
	- Fine to coarse-grained tannins
	- Tasted towards the center of the tongue
- **Grape tannins**
	- Coarse and bitter tannins, typically more abrasive
	- Naturally occurring polyphenols in the skins, seeds, and stems of grapes
	- Tasted towards the sides of the mouth
		- Taste more “green”

### Tasting Tannin
Tannin is the drying effect on the finish of the wine.  Tasting tannin is similar to drinking tea, perceived as a cotton ball-like drying sensation  Makes lips stink to your teeth.  The astringency of tannin creates the feeling of your cheeks being sucked in and the moisture evaporating from your mouth.

Unsweetened black tea is a great example of nearly pure tannin dissolved in water.  Other high tannin foods include tea leaves, walnuts, almonds, dark chocolate, cinnamon, clove

#### Tasting Tannin vs Tasting Acid
- Tannins taste bitter on the front-inside of your mouth and along the side of your tongue.
	- Acid tastes tart and zesty on the front of your tong and along the sides
- Acid makes your mouth feel wet (activates the saliva glands underneath your tongue
	- Tannin makes your tongue feel dry
- Tannins leave a lingering bitter/dry feeling in your mouth after you swallow
	- Acid your tongue feels gravelly against the roof of your mouth
	- 


### Describing Tannin
- Medium-low tannin
	- If detectable at all
	- Pinot Noirs are great examples
- Medium tannins
	- Mild to moderate bitterness
	- Malbecs
- Medium-high tannins
	- Rough sensation on the tongue and varying levels of bitterness
	- Cabernet Sauvignons, Merlots, Syrahs, Zinfandels
- High
	- Very astringent with gripping sensation in the front of mouth
	- Moderately high bitterness
	- Bordeaux Blends, Petite Sirah, Port

#### Describing Slightly Tannic Wines
“This is a really juicy wine and is quite soft with very little tannin structure”

#### Describing Heavily Tannic Wines
“Wow! I can feel the grittiness and my mouth is drying out from the heavy, robust tannins in this red.”

#### Descriptive Words for Tannin
- Bitter
	- Bitter tannin is very intense and ‘green’
- Harsh
	- Tannin that dries out your mouth
- Aggressive
	- Tannin that drowns out the other wine flavors
- Grippy

# Fruit
Not to be confused with “Sweetness”, this is the ripeness and intensity of the fruit that’s detected both on the nose and on the palate.   

The flavors that are found in the wines are largely due to the climate, the grape variety, and the winemaking choices like using oak or not.  Choosing the right harvest date has a disproportionate effect on the flavors.

### Key Points

# Sweetness
All wines are dry, but some wines have a residual sugar that will make them taste sweet.  Often, people will confuse fruit-forward for sweet when describing wines, but that would be the previous attribute (fruit).   This is especially true for very ripe fruit flavors

Sweetness is tasted on the front of your tongue.

Sweetness can be balanced by other components of the wine, especially acid and tannins.  Wines with high acid will taste less sweet.

### Key Points
Sweetness is determined by the type of grape, but can be controlled by the winemaker by stopping the fermentation before the yeast eats all the grape sugars.  Sometimes the grape is so sweet that the yeast struggles to convert all the sugar and dies without finishing.

Winemakers can also add a sugar solution between fermentations  called a **dosage** and is used commonly during sparkling wine production.

Since most people cannot taste sweetness below 20g/L of residual sugar, when wines have between 1 - 3 g/L, it really just adds body to the wine.

- **Residual Sugar**
	- Unfermented grape sugars
	- Sweetness range of Beverages is from 0 grams per Liter to 600 grams per Liter
		- Milk is 50 g/L
		- Coke is 113 g/L
	- Wines range from 0g/L of residual sugar up to 220g/L
		- < 1g/L of residual sugar (0.1% sweetness)
			- Bone Dry
		- 4 g/L of residual sugar
			- this is the human threshold for perceiving sugar
		- 6 - 9 g/L of residual sugar
			- Most wines are here
		- < 10g/L of residual sugar
			- This is where dry wines draw the line. After this they are sweet
		- 20 g/L of residual sugar (2% sweetness)
			- the common wine drinker can barely distinguish sweetness below this
		- < 35 g/L of residual sugar (<3.5% sweetness)
			- Off-Dry
		- 30 - 40 g/L of residual sugar
			- Sweet rieslings are here
		- < 120 g/L of residual sugar (up to 12% sweetness)
			- Sweet Wines
			- Sweet like Coca-Cola
		- > 120 g/L of residual sugar (over 12% sweetness)
			- Very Sweet Wines
		- 220g/L of residual sugar would have the consistency of syrup
- 4 Macro-Levels of Sweetness
	- Level 0 — Bone Dry
		- No perceived sweetness at all 
	- Level 1 — Dry
		- Just a touch of sweetness for balance
	- Level 2 — Medium
		- Definitely sweet but not overtly, well balanced
		- Noticeable but not a major feature of the wine
	- Level 3 — Sweet
		- Unctuously sweet
- Sparkling Wines have their own sweetness scale based on the residual sugar in the wine. 
	- 0 - 12 grams / Liter (Brut)
		- < 3 g/L
			- Brut Nature
		- < 6 g/L
			- Extra-Brut
		- < 12 g/L

#### Pairing With Sweetness
Sweet wines have great pairing potential because there are so many flavor combinations that we already love: sweet & salty, sweet & sour, and sweet & sweet.

Sweet works great with spicy because sugar is a powerful force against burning mouths as it absorbs a lot of capsaicin.  The residual sugar in rieslings will dull the heat and let you taste the underlying flavors in the food.
- Sweet & Salty
	- Pair Port with Blue Cheese
- Sweet & Fatty
	- Sauternes with Foie Gras
	- Bacon-wrapped scallops with Marsala
- Sweet & Sweet
	- Tawny Port and apple pie
- Sweet & Spicy
	- Moscato and hot wings

### Tasting Sweetness
To determine if a wine is sweet instead of just having sweet ripe fruit flavors, lick your lips after sipping the wine.  If your lips are a bit sticky or taste sweet, there’s likely some sugar in the wine!  

Sweetness is felt at the tip of the tongue.  Sweeter wines have an enriched viscosity, which you can also see as legs on the side of the glass.  This can lead to an oily feeling on your tongue.

- **Using ABV**to measure sweetness
	- A dry wine will have a higher ABV as most of the sugar has been transformed
		- Up towards 14% or higher
	- Looking for a sweet wine, look for an ABV around 11% or lower
- **Aroma** 
	- A wine that opens with sweet floral, fruity, or honeyed notes tells your brain that it will be sweet because you associate those smells with a sweet taste.
	- Sweet women are described as “aromatic”

### Describing Sweetness

“Oh, there’s just a hint of sweetness on the tip of my tongue, but there’s lots of juicy acidity to keep it lively and fresh”

#### Describing A fully Sweet White
“Everything you ever wanted in a dessert wine — it’s rich and unctuous and viscous and beautifully sweet, like the best 3-Michelin star dessert you’ve ever had”

# Body
This is the overall weight of the wine in your mouth.  Most websites describe the various levels of body in wine in relation to the various mouth-coating levels when you go from skim milk to whole milk.  So in theory, a full-bodied wine would feel similar to whole milk whereas the lightest bodied wines will feel like fat-free milk in your mouth.  

Generally, the more alcohol in a wine, the more body it will have.  That means that wines from warmer climates tend to have more body, more heft to them.

### Key Points
When pairing wines with food, you need to make sure you match the body with body.  You don’t want to have a light wine matched up against a heavy dish.  The food would overpower the wine.

Climate matters  a lot when it comes to the body of a wine.  Cool climates produce lighter-bodied wines while warmer climates produce bolder wines.   So if you’re going for a light-bodied white wine, you’d lean more towards Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blancs from cooler climates whereas if you’re looking for a full-bodied white wine then look towards the warm climate Chardonnay or Viognier.

- 4 Macro-Levels of Body
	- Level 0 — Delicate Body
		- Very light-bodied wines
		- Similar to fat-free milk
	- Level 1 — Elegant Body
		- Light-bodied wines similar to low-fat (1%) milk
	- Level 2 — Dense Body
		- Much weightier wines similar to reduced-fat (2%) milk
	- Level 3 — Opulent Body
		- The fullest, heaviest wines similar to whole milk
- Wines by Body (Lightest to Fullest)
	- White Wines
		- Sparkling
		- Riesling
		- Pinot Gris
		- Sauvignon Blanc
		- Sémillon
		- Viognier
		- Chardonnay
	- Red Wines
		- Pinot Noir
		- Cabernet Franc
		- Merlot
		- Bordeaux Blend
		- Cabernet Sauvignon
		- Malbec
		- Petit Sirah
		- Syrah
		- Zinfandel
		- Port

#### Light-Bodied White Wines
The “Beer of Wine”, perfect to drink with most food.  In particular, people who like more savory flavors would enjoy a Sauvignon Blanc for its light, zesty style and green herbal flavors.  

#### Full-Bodied White Wines
Perfect for red wine lovers because of their rich smooth taste and subtle creaminess from oaking.  The more oak, the smoother and creamier. 

#### Light-Bodied Red Wines
Like a Pinot Noir or a Beaujolais, they tend to be paler in color due to their light tannins.  A cooler climate Pinot Noir would appeal to light-bodied fans. 

#### Medium-Bodied Red Wines
The “Food Wines”, they tend to have tons of flavor with a balance of zesty acidity and match a wide variety of foods. Here you’ll find wines like a Grenache, Sangiovese, Merlot, Zinfandel, or Cabernet Franc.

#### Full-Bodied Red Wines
These are the deepest and darkest red wines with the most tannins.  The tannins in the wine bind to proteins in the saliva for a palate-cleansing effect, which is why a bold red like a Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, or Malbec will pair well with juicy fatty steaks.

### Tasting Body
When we sense body in beverages, it’s really us sensing a combination of four of the other five attributes.  Fruit Intensity really doesn’t affect body, but tannin, sweetness, acidity, and alcohol levels all play a role in how we feel the wine’s body.
- Tannin 
	- Tannin increases the body of a wine. 
		- This means that since red wines have tannin and white wines do not, red wines almost automatically taste fuller than most white wines.
- Sweetness
	- Remember, this is the residual sugar in the wine.
	- Sweetness increases the body of a wine.
		- Some dryer wines keep a bit of sweetness to increase their body.
- Acidity
	- Acidity decreases body.
	- Cooler climates with their more acidic grapes create lighter wines
- Alcohol
	- Alcohol increases the sense of body.  
- Carbonation
	- Bubbles decreases the sense of body.
### Describing Body
#### Describing a light-bodied white wine
“This is a brilliant white, and it is crisp and mineral and in the mouth it feels a lot like skim milk”  
“Almost airy and ethereal in texture”

#### Describing a Full-Bodied Red Wine
“It is just unbelievably rich and weighty, like taking a big gulp of whole milk, maybe even chocolate milk.”
“Totally hedonistic and delicious”
