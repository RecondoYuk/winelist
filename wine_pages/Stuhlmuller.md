## Provenance
### Winery

### Region
**Alexander Valley**

**Vineyards** → Stuhlmuller Vineyrds, located in souther Alexander Valley, converges with two highly regarded Sonoma County appellations, Chalk Hill and Russian River Valley. On its eastern edge, the 150-acre vineyard borders the Russian River. Situated in a location that is part river bench-lands and part hillside, the vineyard benefits from its alluvial gravel soils and the rockier soils of the hillside sections.

### Winemaking 
**The Vintage** → Following a cool, mild growing season, an August heat spell accelerated ripening, resulting in an earlier start to harvest than normal. Our vineyard set an average size crop, and thanks to a full canopy, we had ideal shade on the fruit. As a result, our vines produced pristine grapes, with excellent natural acidity, lovely balance, and pure varietal flavors. We harvested our 2020 Chardonnay from August 18th through September 2nd with average brix of 22.5 degrees.

**Winemaking** → For complexity and texture, we did a traditional pigeage on roughly one third of the fruit, leaving it in bins for three hours of skin contact before pressing. To accentuate the signature fruit and natural nuttiness of our Estate grapes, we also fermented this wine with 100% indigenous yeast.

## Wine
### Grapes
100% Chardonnay
 - **Clones** → The famous Upper Barn clone, one of California’s most sought-after Chardonnay selections, comprises 85% of the grapes that went into the 2020 Estate Chardonnay blend. The balance is from the Wente/FPS72 clone. From the Upper Barn clone, this wine derives flavors of Asian pear, spice, and a natural nuttiness, while the small clusters and berries of the Wente clone contribute concentrated tropical flavors.

### Tasting Notes
Our 2020 Chardonnay begins with aromas of lemon blossom, white nectarine, wet stone minerality, Bartlett pear, white flowers, and white tea. You are welcomed with flavors of Grenadier apple, notes of lemon cream, thyme, and salt roasted cashews. This wine is sleek and elegant with medium body and a palate supported by bright, food-friendly acid and subtle textural notes from the French Oak and sur lie aging
