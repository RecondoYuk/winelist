<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>
<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<ul>
  <li>LEED Platinum and Living Building-certified Silver Oak winery</li>
  <li>Silver Oak began over a handshake between two friends with a bold vision: focus on one varietal, Cabernet Sauvignon, aged exclusively in American oak and worthy of cellaring for decades to come.
    <ul>
      <li>Ray Twomey Duncan, a Colorado entrepreneur who began investing in California vineyards in the late 1960s, and Justin Meyer, a Christian Brothers-trained winemaker, co-founded Silver Oak out of a Napa Valley dairy barn in 1972, producing only 1,000 cases of their inaugural vintage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>“We have yet to make our best bottle of wine,” or the idea that our best wines are still ahead of us, is a founding philosophy that still guides us to this day.</li>
      <li>We farm more than 400 acres of vines in Napa Valley and Alexander Valley with a leading-edge approach toward farming and viticulture, and the softest possible impact on natural resources and the environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="region">Region</h3>
<p><strong>Alexander Valley, California</strong></p>

<p>Alexander Valley bench soils diversely combine material from the weathering of the Mayacamas Mountains with gravel and sandy loam deposited by the Russian River. The result is a benchland of vibrant, mineral-rich soils that also drain beautifully, a quality critical to growing world-class Cabernet Sauvignon. Situated between 200 and 250 feet, our Alexander Valley Estate, Miraval, Red Tail, Big River and Crazy Creek vineyards all lie above of the overly fertile valley floor, but not so high that ripening becomes an issue. Until 2011 and a 40-vintage tradition, Silver Oak Alexander Valley was always composed solely of Cabernet Sauvignon.  However, blending experiments taught us that small additions of Merlot and Cabernet Franc could add a touch of silk and spice that made an even more compelling wine. These components are now permanent features of the Alexander Valley blend.</p>

<h3 id="winemaking">Winemaking</h3>
<p><strong>Vintage Description</strong> → Mother Nature made a memorable impression on the 2017 vintage. In January we welcomed epic winter rains that brought an end to the enduring five-year drought. The generous precipitation filled our water tables and woke up the vines. After an average bud break, prolific shoot and vegetation growth early in the season required close observation and much weed control and leafing to open the dense canopies. Bloom proceeded at a steady pace and set us up for a healthy crop size. In June and July, three extended heat events tested our vineyard team and culminated with high temperatures around Labor Day. While the hot weather kick-started harvest on September 4, our irrigation management and cooler, foggy mornings allowed the vines to recover and resume their trajectory towards full aromatic and physiological ripeness. We were happy to see sugars and acids at normal levels. The pace of harvest was steady and we had thankfully finished picking before the wildfires started on the night of October 8. While 2017 certainly presented its share of challenges, it was also the jubilant, inaugural vintage for our new, state-of-the-art facility we had been planning, designing, and building since we purchased the Alexander Valley property in 2012.</p>

<p>Ruby in color with a purple rim. Warm and inviting, it has notes of red currant, cassis, ripe plum, cardamom, and toffee. There’s depth and weight on the palate — a harmonious intensity. This wine has a long and beautiful finish, and its fine tannins will provide drinking pleasure through 2043 with proper cellaring.</p>
