<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<p>The concept of Cape Dâ€™Or came to life when Ernst Storm, Tiaan Bezuidenhout, and Parker Wittbrodt who all live in Santa Barbara County came together and enjoyed a bottle of South African wine. Sitting around a kitchen table with a glass in hand, they reminisced about their time spent in South Africa and the exceptional wines from the Western Cape. With twenty+ years of experience in the wine and hospitality industries, they knew that these unique, high-quality South African wines needed to be shared with other wines enthusiasts.</p>

<p>The fruit for this Cabernet Sauvignon was sourced from sustainable, dry land vineyards in South Africa. These vineyards are located in the Western Cape region of South Africa where cool afternoon breezes allow for favorable ripening conditions. Working with fruit from some of the oldest deposits of granite and shale soils on the planet allow for a balance between old world texture and new world freshness.</p>

<p>The 2020 Cape Dâ€™Or Caberneet Sauvignon is made with a minimal intervention wine making approach. The goal here is to allow the varietal to showcase its true characteristics. Aromas of dark fruit, subtle spices, and hits of licorice are met with a well-structured mouthfeel, showcasing a classical cabernet tannin structure.</p>
