<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Marc Piro knew he wanted to be a winemaker when he was 9 years old. He sat in the crowded backseat of his family’s station wagon as they drove through the vineyards of Sonoma’s Dry Creek Valley, and, inspired, he announced, “Mom, I want a vineyard.” Her response was curt, “Well, then, get a good job.” He now works with the Au Bon Climat and Qupé wineries in Santa Maria, with Jim Clendenen and Bob Lindquist, two of the legendary names of Santa Barbar County. He also had a pretty legendary roommate in college, Mr Rob Thibaut!</li>
  <li>The brilliant work of Santa Barbara’s über-talented, second-generation vintners has become unavoidable: These wines have serious international clout, they’ve dismantled Premier and Grand Cru Burgundies in blind tastings … a new project springs up every fortnight … [hard] to find the diamonds. Piro is one of those diamonds, and our white-hot enthusiasm during our tasting convinced us this will be a must-watch name in the coming years… wine critic Antonio Galloni …claim[ed] that “Marc Piro is one of Santa Barbara’s most promising young Pinot producers.” That ringing endorsement is fully confirmed in today’s 2018 “Points West” Pinot Noir. It’s packed with a velvet-gloved punch to turn around any lingering naysayers and double-loaded with terroir and elegance for lifelong Pinot disciples.”</li>
  <li>After graduating from college, Marc Piro knew one of the few jobs he could land that required no previous winemaking experience was working the night shift at a behemoth custom-crush facility in Gisborne, New Zealand. Pressing endless tons of bulk-grade Sauvignon Blanc was hardly glamorous but it carved the first notch on his winemaking belt. From there, he jetted down to South Island stronghold Villa Maria to catch a second harvest that same year (2011). He was back to the States just in time to jump in the harvest operations at Thacher Vineyards in Paso Robles. It was here that Sherman Thacher introduced him to famed Argentine grower, Santiago Achával, who was collaborating on a new Paso Robles venture, so the following year found him working harvest at Achával-Ferrer in Mendoza. Writing a winning essay sponsored by UC Davis’ Enology/Viticulture Department landed him an internship with Santa Maria Valley gurus Jim Clendenen (Au Bon Climat) and Bob Lindquist (Qupé). Once that yearlong gig was up, he squeezed in another Southern Hemisphere harvest at Vasse Felix. Marc’s desire to settle down somewhere on the Central Coast serendipitously coincided with the need for an assistant winemaker back at Clendenen’s home base. He’s been there ever since, and 2021 will be Marc’s tenth harvest at Au Bon Climat / Qupé. To this day, it’s where he crafts his eponymous label, starting with just two barrels of Pinot Noir in 2014.</li>

<h3 id="region">Region</h3>
<p><strong>Northern Santa Barbara County, California</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Santa Maria Valley (two sites)
    <ul>
      <li>Presqu’ile</li>
      <li>Runway</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In Northern Santa Barbara County, the Santa Maria Valley is producing some of the greatest Pinot Noir on the planet. Thanks to a specific microclimate, made possible by the unique, east-west cooling effects of the <strong>Transverse Ranges</strong> off the coast of the Pacific, this distinct region of California delivers a Burgundian expression much like the best of Oregon, with slightly more texture and explosive fruit. The appellation’s well-situated vineyards and moderate temperatures result in the ideal, trifecta combination found in top-tier Pinot Noir: ripeness, tension, and aromatic complexity. For this impressive 2018 Piro “Points West” cuvée, Marc blends two ultra-premium Pinot Noir sites inthe Santa Maria Valley: Presqu’ile and Runway.
    <ul>
      <li>Presqu’ile  → located 15 miles east of the Pacific ocean, it sits on ancient dunes and these sandy soils create elegant wines with high-toned aromatics, structure, and minerality. The farming here is sustainable and hyper-vigilant.</li>
      <li>Runway vineyard → shares its property line with the western edge of the Bien Nacido Estate, arguably the most famous vineyard in the United States. Planted in 2008 with high-grade clonal selections, Runway’s Pinot Noir vines are rooted in sandy topsoils packed with significant amounts of clay, providing more “flesh and opulent, mid-palate fruit” to this wine according to Marc. He adds, “I’d say Runway has cooler nights and Presqu’ile has cooler days.” Capturing the best of both worlds, he blended 58% Runway fruit with 42% Presqu’ile in this 2018.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="winemaking">Winemaking</h3>
<p>Hand-harvested, hand-sorted and 100% de-stemmed, today’s 2018 Piro Points West Pinot Noir was fermented in open-top tanks through a 14-day maceration period. The two vineyard lots were fermented and aged separately. Afterward, the wine was pressed and put in French Oak barrels. The wine remained in barrel, aging for 21 months prior to a final blending and unfiltered bottling.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Serve at 60˚F in a Burgundy Stem According to SommSelect’s Wine Notes, it had a chart 5 circles:
    <ul>
      <li>Fruit  → 4 out of 5</li>
      <li>Earth → 3 out of 5</li>
      <li>Body → 3.5 out of 5</li>
      <li>Tannin  → 3 out of 5</li>
      <li>Acid  → 3.5 out of 5</li>
      <li>Alcohol  → 3 out of 5</li>

<p>Bristling with energy, this remarkable effor possesses a striking purity of fruit and exceptional balance. In the glass, it reveals a deep ruby-garnet hue with magenta highlights toward the rim. An enchanting uppter register of aromatics jumps forward with vivid red berry fruit, kola nut, ripe cherry, blood orange, baking spice, dried flowers, and anise. The medium-bodied palate hums with verve, ripeness, and intensity before finishing with a commanding, chiseled freshness. Over the course of an hour, Piro’s 2018 “Points West” slowly revealed layer after nuanced layer.</p>
