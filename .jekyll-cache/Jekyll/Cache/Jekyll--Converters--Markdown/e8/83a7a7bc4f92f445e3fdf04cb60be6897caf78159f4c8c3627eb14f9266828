<p>Learning ‚ÄúWine Knowledge‚Äù in the restaurant industry can be a little intimidating at first, especially when you learn about words like <em>sommelier</em> (wine pro) and <em>oenophile</em> (wine lover).  Then add in all the different grapes, winemaking methods, climates, dirt flavors, or whether they danced naked with magical crystals around their necks as they harvested the grapes.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs even a bunch of chemistry.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Liquid + Sugar + Yeast = Ethanol + CO<sub>2</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But really, ferment some juice and you have wine.</p>

<p>You can make it in a toilet!</p>

<p>So to make you feel better about how easy wine is, here are the instructions to making <strong>Toilet Wine</strong></p>

<h3 id="materials-needed">Materials Needed</h3>
<p><strong>A Bag</strong><br />
You‚Äôre gonna want to find a clean, unused garbage bag or other  watertight bag.  Gotta be clean though.  You‚Äôre in prison so you got enough challenges, keeping bacteria out of your wine is gonna keep that upper-decker pinot at it‚Äôs best flavor.</p>

<p><strong>A Sock</strong><br />
Might sound gross, but the thinner the better.  As long as you can get it super-clean (see note above about bacteria), use a really old sock.</p>

<p><strong>A shiv</strong><br />
According to television prison, you‚Äôre really gonna want one of those.  Dealers choice on whether you want to go with just the stabby-pointy kind where you sharpen a toothbrush, or if you wanna go more elaborate with a razor blade set-up.  <br />
I get it, I have seen <em>Orange is the New Black</em>.  You do you.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-farming">Step 1: Farming</h2>
<h3 id="the-fruit">The Fruit</h3>
<p>The basis of all wine is the fruit that it comes from. The <em>liquid</em> from the equation above, and you‚Äôve got to figure out what you‚Äôre going to use.</p>

<p>In real-world wine, humans have been using grapes as the juice-producer for thousands of years.  You can use any fruit, and the juicier the better.,</p>

<p>In prison, you‚Äôre kind of on your own.  At this point you can use your shiv to threaten the cook and steal what you need, but you‚Äôre going to need a lot.   Plus, a lot of vineyards are beginning to practice <em>sustainable farming</em> so you might as well try to do the same.  Plus, don‚Äôt add to your time.</p>

<p>So make a deal with the kitchen staff to set aside a bunch of old fruit for a week for you.  Preferably grapes, but you‚Äôll take whatever.</p>

<p>The riper the better!!! You want those sugars in the fruit.  You owe your cell-block  a nice, clean flavored wine.  Have some pride in your craft!</p>

<p>If you go with the violent way, get whatever you can.  You can even use ketchup packets in a crunch.</p>

<h3 id="the-yeast">The Yeast</h3>

<p>Now you need something to change the juice into alcohol.  Yeast eats sugar and then poops out et ethanol and carbon-dioxide.</p>

<p>Real-world most winemakers use the indigenous yeasts that grow on their grapes, although 1 in 5 winemakers throughout the world add yeast to their juice during fermentation.</p>

<p>For your sake, you‚Äôre going to want to get a few pieces of fresh bread.</p>

<p>When you get back to to your cell, lick the bread so it‚Äôs all moist.  Then stick it in your <strong>bag</strong> from the inventory list, make sure it‚Äôs water-tight, and then stick it in the upper deck of your toilet or tuck it behind your toilet.</p>

<p>The point is, you want that slice of bread to grow some mold on it over the next  few days while your <em>farmers</em> in the kitchen gather your fruit.</p>

<h3 id="some-sugar">Some Sugar</h3>

<p>Unless you‚Äôre in one of those high-end Martha-Stuart-level prisons, I expect you‚Äôre not going to be making your wine from just grapes.</p>

<p>That means you‚Äôre going to need to add some sugar as well as more liquid to help whatever fruit (or ketchup) that you have to use.  Plus, if you want some bubbly toilet-wine, you‚Äôre going to need extra sugar anyways.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure you want to add any more pressure on the kitchen at this point. They‚Äôre already gathering fruit for you and gave you some fresh bread.  You should probably just spend this week getting sugar from the coffee table that preacher brings to the AA meetings.  It‚Äôs prison, did you get there for being honest?</p>

<p>Spend this week  sharpening your shiv and checking on your vineyard.  Make sure that your workers are moving the fruit out of the hot kitchen and into the walk-in cooler at night, you don‚Äôt want your fruit to get overripe.  Be careful for hazards like inspections that could destroy your crop!</p>

<p>In the real world, winemakers are watching their vineyard conditions like hawks, so you should too.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-harvest">Step 2: Harvest</h2>

<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<p>Ok.  Time to venture out of your cell to get some supplies. Welcome to harvesting season!  In the wine-world, this is when they go out and pick the grapes.   You‚Äôre in prison, so your harvest has got to be a trip to the kitchen.<br />
In the real world, you would choose which parts of your vineyard to harvest grapes from, based on the ripeness levels.</p>

<h3 id="get-some-staff">Get some staff</h3>
<p>You may want to recruit some temporary workers to help you sneak your fruit from the kitchen to your cell.  This happens a lot, but just make sure they are allowed to cross the territories they need to cross.  You don‚Äôt want to lose your harvest because one of your hired help doesn‚Äôt have the right gang identification.  My understanding is that‚Äôs bad in prison.<br />
In the real world, winemakers use seasonal help because they need to pick all their grapes in a short amount of time.</p>

<h3 id="choose-the-harvest-date">Choose the Harvest Date</h3>
<p>Winemakers not behind bars will take especial care while they pick their grapes.  They‚Äôll choose when to pick the grapes based on how ripe they are and whether they contain the right balance of chemicals for the wine style they‚Äôre going for.  Harvest date is an important date for wine.</p>

<p>You and your cellmate(s) can perhaps a party to celebrate your harvest.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-winemaking">Step 3: Winemaking</h2>
<p>You wake up from your big celebration, perhaps feeling a bit sore in ways you‚Äôve never felt before, but it‚Äôs time to get to the work of making your wine.</p>

<h3 id="get-set-up">Get Set Up</h3>
<p>Probably going to want to do this when everyone else is out at the yard or some such, but set everything  you need out.  You‚Äôve got a limited amount of time before everyone gets back and you don‚Äôt want to risk any extra issues.</p>

<p>Pull your now hopefully really moldy bread out of the <strong>bag</strong> and put it into your <strong>sock</strong> from the inventory list.</p>

<p>Wash your fruit.</p>

<p>Get your sugar set up.  Resist the urge to put your face in the pile like Scarface.</p>

<p>Get some clean water.  You‚Äôre drinking this later, so no toilet water.</p>

<h3 id="make-the-juice">Make the Juice</h3>
<p>Take your fruit and get as much juice as you can.  Grapes and ripe fruits excel here, but you‚Äôre forgiven because of your surroundings.</p>

<p>Juice the fruit into the plastic <strong>bag</strong>.  Unless you‚Äôre using grapes, don‚Äôt put in the skins.  In the real world, winemaking diverges here between red or white wines.  In red wines (and ros√© wines), winemakers will leave the skins and stems in the juice. This stains the juice and adds tannins.</p>

<p>You can give it a whirl if you want with your toilet wine, but we are going the white wine way of making wine.  We want just the juice and no skins.</p>

<p>At this point you may want to add some of the water if you don‚Äôt have enough liquid for the amount of wine you want to make.</p>

<p>Add some sugar to <em>fortify</em> the wine if you‚Äôd like.  This will add sugar for the yeast to eat so it will poop out more alcohol.  You do you!</p>

<h3 id="ferment">Ferment</h3>

<p>Now‚Äôs time to add some yeast to the equation.  Everything‚Äôs ready, you just need something to go in and eat all the fruit sugars and produce the alcohol that you so desperately need to help survive prison.</p>

<p>Add your moldy-bread-filled <strong>sock</strong> to the mixture.  Picture it as a giant teabag of yeast to get the process going.</p>

<p>Store this bag of goodness inside the back of your toilet.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to let this just sit and ferment for a while.</p>

<p>Periodically you‚Äôre going to want to massage the bag.  Move the juice and sugars around so that the yeast can eat everything it can.</p>

<h3 id="burp-or-hold-it">Burp or Hold It</h3>

<p>While your toilet-wine ferments, it‚Äôs going to fill the bag with carbon dioxide.  Bubbles.  Lots of bubbles.  If you seal it tight, your bag‚Äôs going to explode and make a giant mess.</p>

<p>Do you want to explain that mess to your cellmate?</p>

<p>So you‚Äôre going to want to <em>burp</em> the bag and let the bubbles out.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre lucky enough to have bottles to store your wine in, you can always switch the juice to those bottles, add a little sugar and then cork them.  You and the boys will celebrate big with this toilet-bubbly!</p>

<p>For our sake though, we‚Äôre aiming for a Chardonnay style white wine so we don‚Äôt want bubbles.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-aging--storing">Step 4: Aging / Storing</h2>
<p>Once the bubbles have calmed down, you know that the yeast has eaten all the sugar it can and died out.</p>

<p>Yup, the life of yeast is to eat until it dies.  If there‚Äôs any sugar left in the juice at this point we call it <em>residual sugar</em>.  Sweeter wines have this in them, and sometimes there‚Äôs <em>residual sugar</em> because the winemakers killed the yeast before it could eat all the sugar.</p>

<p>At this point you have wine to drink.  It‚Äôll have some bite to it and you may want to water down the final product a bit like the Romans used to, but you can go to town.</p>

<h3 id="oaking-and-aging">Oaking and Aging</h3>

<p>Or you can change some of the flavors by ‚Äúoaking‚Äù the wine.  In the real world this is done with barrels that wine is stored in.  The wood interacts with the wine to change some of the harsher flavors into softer, creamier flavors.</p>

<p>They use oak instead of other trees because that wood grows very ‚Äútight‚Äù so it‚Äôs naturally watertight.</p>

<p>You get to use whatever you can.   I doubt you‚Äôll find any unused toasted French oak barrels anywhere in prison, but really you just need wood.</p>

<p>If you use pencils, make sure to only use the wood part and not the paint, the eraser, or the lead.  You may just have to steal a nicknack off the warden‚Äôs desk.</p>

<p>Drop that wood into your fermented juice and let it sit for as long as you want.  The longer the wood sits in contact with the wine, the smoother and creamier.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-drink">Step 5: Drink!</h2>
<p>Strain all your wine out into a fresh container.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the bag you‚Äôre going to see some sludge.  This is all the dead yeast, the <em>lees</em>.  You don‚Äôt really want to drink this.</p>

<p>Well, you‚Äôve made your wine and rebottled it.  Now it‚Äôs up to you on how you want to use it!  Do you want to use it to buy yourself some safety?  Do you need to pay off all the debts it took to get the ingredients?</p>

<p>Or maybe you just need to drink it all yourself because the wife started bringing her friend ‚ÄúBrett‚Äù from work when she visits you and the judge added three years because you shanked the cook.   You do you, but that‚Äôs how you make wine in a toilet.</p>
