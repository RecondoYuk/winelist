<p><em>Fresh, Clean, Mineral, Granny Smith Apple, Toasted Bread</em><br />
<em>A clean, crisp Brut with some of the complexity of Champagne but for a fraction of the price</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Name: Poema</li>
  <li>Style: Cava Brut</li>
  <li>Vintage:</li>
  <li>Scores: NV
    <ul>
      <li><em>Wine Enthusiast</em> 87pts
        <ul>
          <li>“Except for a hint of lime, this basic brut Cava smells neutral. A simple palate is citrusy and in solid shape. Generic white-fruit flavors come with mild green notes of celery and scallion. It’s lively but lacks flavor on the finish.” – Michael Schachner</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Producer
    <ul>
      <li>Name of the Winery: Poema
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address</strong> →</li>
          <li><strong>Telephone</strong> →</li>
          <li><strong>Website</strong> → https://www.poemacava.com/cava-brut</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Provenance: Poema carefully observes the Cava DO’s stringent regulations to craft its top-quality, small-production Cavas, which are made using the same traditional method used in Champagne. The grapes are grown in the limestone hills surrounding Barcelona on vines that are a minimum of 20 years old. A green harvest and careful selection help to ensure that only ripe, pristine grapes are picked. Grapes are harvested manually and pressed in three different wineries close to the vineyards before each lot is fermented separately. With 55% of the must free-run juice, the grapes are fermented in stainless steel tanks, then the lots are blended and second fermentation takes place in the bottle according to Método Tradicional (the second fermentation that makes the bubbles takes place inside the bottle). Residual sugar is 5 g/l.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Points of Distinction</strong> → A small-production, quality-oriented Spanish wine producer crafting top value Cava.  Poema owns 20% of the vineyard sources’ the rest are under long-term contract with growers who follow strict quality specifications. Fruit is sustainably farmed, using organic fertilizer and no herbicides.</li>
          <li><strong>What is Cava</strong> → Spain adopted the word, <em>cava</em> which technically means ‘cellar’ in Catalan, to describe their sparkling wines made using the traditional method. While this style was first created outside of Spain in the 1600s, its birthplace inside of Spain came in 1872 when Jose Raventós of Cordoníu first produced traditional method sparkling wine in the town of San Sadurní d’Anoia. Uniquely, the Cava denomination isn’t restricted to one geographical area byt rather it spans eight total wine regions.</li>
          <li><strong>Cava Pairings</strong> → One of the best things about pairing Cava wine is you can drink it on its own or with just about any food! But if you want to focus on bringing out Cava’s uniquely brilliant bouquet and citrus notes, rich or seafood-centric dishes are perfect pairings for Cava. Try Cava with butter poached lobster, seafood risotto, puff pastry and vcaramelized onions or fried chicken.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Region: Spain / Penedes
    <ul>
      <li>Sourced from 152 hectacres of vineyards located between the high, central, and low regions of the Penedes valley in the Catalan province of Barcelona with each region best suited for specific varietals.</li>
      <li>The Penedès valley’s three regions offer perfect terroirs for growing the trio of indigenous grapes used to craft traditional Cava.
        <ul>
          <li>The High Penedès (over 500 meters above sea level) is hilly with a chalky soil, ideal for the Paralleada grape</li>
          <li>Low and Central (up to 500 meters above sea level) Penedès’s limestone and clay soils are excellent matches for the Macabeo and Xarel-lo grapes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Grapes: 40% Macabeo, 40% Xarel-lo, 20% Parellada
    <ul>
      <li>Macabeo (aka Viura) lends pleasant aromatics to the blend</li>
      <li>Parellada adds acidity and finesse</li>
      <li>Xarel-lo is the grape that gives body, earth, and greengage characteristics to Cava</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Profile:
    <ul>
      <li>Tasting Notes:  Fresh, clean, citrus, mineral, and Granny Smith apple aromas with toasted bread notes make this a great example of cava
        <ul>
          <li>Vibrant aromas of ripe peaches, pears, and toasted bread with a hint of spice fill the nose. The palate is dry with a rich, creamy texture. Layers of flavor include orange rind and spice that persists through an elegant finish.</li>
          <li><strong>Cava Generic Taste Profile</strong> → Dry, Light Body, Low/None Tannins, High Acidity, 10-11.5% ABV</li>
          <li><strong>See</strong> → Pale-intensity lemon in color</li>
          <li><strong>Smell</strong> → This wine has an aromatic, medium-plus-intensity nose of green apple, pear, caramel, blossom, and lemon zest</li>
          <li><strong>Sip</strong> → On the palate the dry, medium-bodied cava has medium-intensity flavors suggested on the nose supported by medium acidity and completeing with a medium finish.</li>
          <li><strong>Savor</strong> → The palate is dry with a rich, creamy texture with an elegant finish</li>
          <li><strong>Body</strong> → The wine has notes of creaminess even as it is mostly straightforward in taste profile.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Food Pairing: Splendid as an apertif, this sparkler is also a good match with light tapas, oysters, and seafood
        <ul>
          <li>Can cut through the weight of fried foods and richer sauces</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Points of Distinction:
        <ul>
          <li>Made utilizing Metodo Tradicional, the same traditional method used to craft Champagne.  This leaves the spent yeast cells remain in contact with the wine during bottle aging, giving it a creamy mouthful, a toasted bread or brioche quality in many cases.</li>
          <li>A true Brut-style Cava, made with indigenous grape varieties</li>
          <li>Made from vines a minimum of 20 years old for greater depth of flavor</li>
          <li>Versatile with tapas and light appetizers</li>

          <li>“There’s a slightly sulfurous character right at the start of this wine that dominates the bouquet, though it blows off to reveal notes of macerated cherry and a touch of menthol. There’s a ripeness upfront on the medium-weight palate, with lush flavors of juicy peach and cherry. The finish is a little soft, but tasty in ripe fruit tones.” – Lauren Buzzeo</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Masterwines was started by Mel and Janie Master in France in 1990 when its main business was sourcing great value wines from the Languedoc region of the south oof France.
        <ul>
          <li>Mel and Janie are from England but are both now US Citizens. Mel has been in the wine business ever since leaving school and he met Janie when they were only twelve and thirteen (she played the piano and he played the guitar!) and as they grew up together, they shared a passion for food and wine. They married at 19 and 20.<br />
  The couple left England to live in France in 1970 and started a company called Master Wines and began selling little known French wines in the USA. Mel was a pioneer in bringing great wine values to the USA from France.</li>

      <li>Provenance: Close to the producers, and in order to source from the best vineyards, our winemaker has found some amazing “<em>terroirs</em>” in South of France.  The Languedoc climatic conditions allow a perfect maturation for the grapes which are moderated by the humid influence of the Mediterranean.
        <ul>
          <li>“Mont” is what the hills are called in French, and “Gravet” is a the name of an oval shaped rock commonly found in the area.</li>
          <li>Montgravet comes from vineyards located in the Gascony region, near the city of Toulouse in the South West of France. The climate combines the Oceanic and Mediterranean influences, which brings enough sun and humidity to grow rich, concentrated and ripe grapes. Close to the producers, and in order to source the best vineyards, our winemaker has found some amazing “terroirs” spread on hills. These hills are called “Mont” in French. So as a tribute to the terroir from where the wine comes from we have named in Montgravet, “Gravet” being the name of an oval shaped rock commonly found in the area.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Grapes: 100% Cinsault
    <ul>
      <li>The grapes are harvested at night when the temperature is cool, in order to prevent from oxidation and to preserve the subtle fruity aromas.  The juice goes through a gentle pressing then the fermentation process at low temperature to enhance the elegant aromatic profile.  The wine stays on its fine lees at least two months and is stirred periodically providing a smooth texture.</li>

      <li>Provenance:  “We began producing Carbonic Sangiovese in 2013 in an effort to make a fresh, delicious version of Sangiovese. Aged in the wine barrel for 30 months and another 6 months in the bottle.
        <ul>
          <li>The extended aging allowed for the tanning and acid to integrate, as the fruit profile and mid-palate richness enveloped any harshness on the finish.</li>
          <li><strong>Carbonic Fermentation</strong> → allowing the grapes to ferment whole, uncrushed in a sealed tank allows for a red wine containing only a fraction of the tannin present in a traditionally fermented red wine.  Without the threat of an overly tannic wine, we can pick earlier at lower sugar.  Because we don’t need to wait for integration, we bottle the wine within a few months of harvest, locking in the fresh-unoxidized profile.</li>
          <li>In 2016, we re-branded Carbonic Sangioves to “Love You Bunches” in a pun on the gentle treatment of the whole grape bunches.  Of course, the simple, whimsical label is the perfect fit for this fun, happy wine, and shows off vineyard manager Ruben Solorzano’s beautiful penmanship.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Region: Lompoc California
    <ul>
      <li>Primarily Block 5 Sangiovese with some Block 3 &amp; A Sangiovese.  Additional Sangiovese fruit, primarily from White Hawk and Sanger Vineyards, augmented this year’s production as was the case in 2017 &amp; 2018</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Grapes: 100% Sangiovese
      - 80% Grenache / 10% Syrah / 10% Mourvedre (According to the Ducke’s Handout)
    <ul>
      <li>Sangiovese as a grape is both highly tannic and high in acid - a one-two combination that can deliver a whopping blow to the palate.</li>
      <li>Before we experimented with carbonic fermentation, we intentionally picked Sangiovese on the ripe side to allow for tannings and acids to soften.</li>

          <li>Ka Boom - cherry sour candy and a crunchy red verve that sings through the mouth, this redefines the STOLPMAN SO FRESH brand.

      <li>Provenance: Driven by one family’s passion for great winemaking, Mohua Wines was founded in 2009 to create exceptional wines from some of New Zealand’s highes quality regions.  Our focus is on merging that vision with sustainable practices to craft wines that capture the essence of their environment, while improving the land that creates them.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Mohua</strong> → A small colorful bird that can only be found in the pristine and majestic forests of New Zealand’s South Island.  Once abundant, they are now classifies as an endangered species, surviving in only remote areas.  Mohua Wines is committed to helping ensure these stunning choristers flourish and regain their rightful place among New Zealand’s unique fauna.</li>
          <li><strong>The Season</strong> → 2021 provided its share of challenges, though was a warmer than average season overall.  Initially impactd by early Spring grosts and followed by a cool flowering period which were the key causes for the small volumes harvested across the region.  Low disease pressure and an early harvest were the result of drought like conditions from December to March, providing only 31% of the average rainfall during this period.  The warm and dry weather pattern throughout much of the growing season allowed the fruit to develop intensity and wonderful balance which has translated beautifully into the finished wine.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Region: Marlborough, NZ
    <ul>
      <li>Marlborough has rapidly developed an international reputation for producing premium Sauvignon Blanc.  The region is situated in the north-eastern corner of New Zealand’s South Island.  Bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east and towering mountain ranges in the hinterlands to the north and south, a broad alluvial plain stretches from the coastline, gradually rising into narrow valleys with favorable northerly aspects.</li>
      <li>In the heart of Marlborough, we source our fruit from three sub-regions selectf for the distinct characters each location brings to the wine. Careful yield control then guarantees exceptional fruit from one of the world’s finenst Sauvignon Blanc regions

The Southern Valleys which feed into the Wairau from the south generally exhibit higher levels of clay than the main Wairau Valley.</li>

      <li>Name of the Winery: Rombauer Vineyards</li>
      <li>Provenance: Rombauer Vineyards began producing Chardonnay in 1982. In 1990, the Rombauer family made their first Chardonnay from the Carneros region, where San Pablo Bay meets the southern end of Napa and Sonoma valleys.  There, the cool climate and clay soils offer ideal conditions for growing superiors Chardonnay with the Rombauer hallmarks → intense fruit flavors balanced by fresh acidity.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Story/History</strong> → Founded in 1980, by Koerner and Joan Rombauer, Rombauer Vineyards has been producing acclaimed wines from Napa Valley and the Sierra Foothills ever since. Still family owned and operated, their winery is known for its high-quality wines, exceptional vineyard sites, and family-style hospitality. “Joy of Wine” on every cork is an homage to the <em>Joy of Cooking</em>, America’s first and top selling cookbook written by Irma Rombauer (Koerner’s great aunt).

      <li><strong>Winegrowing</strong> → Good rains in February lead to a warm summer, which then turned cool in August, resulting in a later harvest than the last few years.  What followed was a long warm fall with near perfect growing conditions and extended hang time. In the end it was one of the longest harvests on record and also above average crop size.  Sustainable farming practices throught the growing season were tailored to each block with the assistance of aerial photos produced using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) technology.  The fruit was hand-picked and sorted in the vineyard.</li>
      <li><strong>Winemaking</strong> → The grapes were gently whole-cluster pressed while the fruit was still cool.  The juice was pumped to tank to cold-settle overnight before it was racked to barrel for primary and malolactic fermentation.  The lees were stirred every two weeks to give the wine rich flavors and a creamy texture.</li>

          <li><strong>Vintage Notes</strong> → A challenging 2019 vintage began warm and wet into early June.  All regions of Western Oregon experienced increased disease pressure from the high soil moisture and associated vegetative growth although our dry-farmed vineyards were happy.  Proper canopy management and sound crop protection practices were crucial for success before summer arrived with average heat accumulation.  Overcast conditions led to the coolest September and October since 2007, helping the fruit maintain acidity and freshness going into harvest.  Interspersed showers during the harvest period slowed fruit development, and ripeness was achieved at lower sugars.  It was a season definitely favoring wineries of fruit quickly in the short picking windows. Vintage 2019 was a true cool climate year, and a reminder that good work and proper timing can achieve great things in Oregon wine.</li>

      <li>Provenance: Winemaker William Knuttel first visited Cafayate eight years ago, and was immediately entranced with the area and its people, culture, and climate.  The town is in the Calchaqui Valley at over 5000’ elevation, nestled in the foothills of the Andes. This area of high mountain desert has the feel of Napa Valley plunked down into Zion Canyon National Park. Vineyards seemingly grow in nothing but rock and sand, surrounded by towering mountains of red rock and granite.<br />
  While Argentina is recognized mostly for the wines of Mendoza to the south, the smaller Cafayate region is rapidly gaining favor – after over 100 years of grape growing! Knuttel believes the region will eventually compare to Mendoza much like Napa Valley does to Sonoma County, and a frenzy of land purchases and winery constructions in the last few years seems to be bearing out this prediction.</li>
      <li>The secret is out that most of the great Torrontes in Argentina is sourced from Cafayate, but recently the region’s robust Malbecs have attracted the most attention. After his previous experiences at Chalk Hill EState, which included extensive experiments focusing on Malbec clones, pruning techniques, and winemaking styles, Knuttel could not resist temptation in Cafayate! Hence, Tentadora “<em>The Temptress</em>” materialized from some of the finest Malbec vineyards he had ever seen, adjacent to those of the region’s most famous Malbecs, San Pedro de Yacochuya, one of the Michel Roland’s projects.</li>

      <li>Tasting Notes: The 2017 Tentadora Malbec features a blueberry and blackberry melange with notes of spice and earth, and a smooth succulent core of fruit that broadens into a velvety finish. The color is inky black, and soft and well-resolved tannins are seamlessly integrated into the finish.

      <li>Provenance:  To make a well-balanced red wine, we blended Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petite Sirah, Alicante, and Malbec from five different appellations in California.  Fruit from Napa Valley lends complexity while Sonoma adds a touch of spice to the blend.  Mendocino fruit gives the wine its color, rich, ripe fruit flavors and tannins. Lake County adds structured tannins and minerality while fruit from Lodi rounds out the blend adding rich flavors and soft texture.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Story/History</strong> → Joel Gott is a fourth-generation California vintner, and wine and food entrepreneur. Maxing out his credit cards, Joel purchased several tons of Amador County Zinfadel from a family friend and grape grower in 1996. He made the wine with the help of his then-girlfriend and winemaker Sarah, whom he married the following year. Praised by the Wine Spectator, the Wine Advocate, and the New York Times, Zinfandel helped put Joel Gott Wines on the map, and gave Joel the chance to produce additional varietals.</li>

September temperatures were cool with little rainfall, resulting in some isolated frost events. Summer was generally hot, with high temperatures delaying veraison.

      <li>Name of the Winery:</li>
      <li>Provenance: This fragrant, delicate Prosecco Rose is a quality selection of the finest Glera and Pinot Noir grapes grown in individual vineyard parcels in the province of Treviso, where limestone-rich soils ensure a firm structure to the wines here.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Region: Treviso, Italy
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vineyards</strong> → The vineyards, all within the Prosecco DOC zone, face sout-southeast at elevations of 70-250 metres. The climate is temperate, with cold winters, warm summers, and consistent ventilation, while the day-night temperature differentials are moderate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Grapes: 100% Glera
    <ul>
      <li>The vines, dense-planted at an average of 4,000 per hectare, are trained to a mixture of spurred cordon and Sylvoz. The grapes are picked exclusively by hand, around mid-September; yields in must average 90 hl/ha.</li>
      <li><strong>Vinification</strong> → After the clusters are destemmed and the grapes pressed, the must spends a brief period on the skins and then is gently pressed off wtih a bladder press. The must is then gravity settled and fermented at 18-20 Celsius. Effervescence is achieved via the Italian Method in 30hl steel pressure fermenters over a period of minimum two months.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Profile:
    <ul>
      <li>Tasting Notes: It appears a lovely, shimmering pale pink, with dense, silky mousse, testifying to the meticulous care lavished on quality selection of the fruit at harvest. The bouquet is generous and fruit-rich, redolent of cherry, raspberry, and wild strawberry. That fruit continues onto a stylish palate, whose crisp acidity gives admirable support to the wine’s harmonious, elegant structure.

This fragrant version uses fruit from the finest vineyards in the zone of Cordignano, Sarmede, and Cappella Maggiore in the hills of Treviso. The three Cosmo brother or “Fratelli” in Italian are known as the Prosecco Brothers: Umberto, Luigi, and Domenico</li>

The adventuresome should try it with young goat and ewes-milk cheese. It will be at its best over the two years following the harvest, and if stored away from light and heat, its bouquet and palate will achieve impressive maturity.</li>

      <li>Name of the Winery: Domaine Carneros</li>
      <li>Provenance: Our Estate Brut is the signature wine of Domaine Carneros. It encompasses an array of clones and blocks from our estate vineyards. The tapestry of flavors that result, married with the inherent finesse of the cool Carneros fruit, create wines of depth and complexity that are enhanced by a minimum of three years of bottle age <em>sur lie</em> in the cellar before release. This extra bottle age yields a complex, toasty aroma and fine pinpoint bubbles.</li>

The palate is round and full, revealing poached pear, crisp apple, yuzu, honeydew melon, and pie crust with a toasty finish that lingers on the palate, begging for another sip. This winery exclusive has been aged to perfection yet will enjoy additional evolution in the cellar over the next decade.

      <li>Points of Distinction: <strong>Harvest Notes</strong> → In 2017, Carneros was gifted with its 3rd wettest winter in 125 years, refilling reservoirs and aquifers that had been depleted in the previous drought years. Happy vines developed healthy canopies which tempered the higher-than-average temperatures and brief heat spikes that characterized the growing season. Harvest began on August 7th, a fairly typical start date in Carneros. The resulting wines show beautiful depth, concentration, and freshness.</li>

      <li>Name of the Winery: Veuve-Clicquot</li>
      <li>Provenance: A champagne House is eventually judged on the quality of its Brut non vintage. It is in the making of such a wine that the true Art of Champagne blending reveals itself. This is an art in which the House of Veuve Clicquot excels. Our Brut Yellow Label reflects the superb vineyards we own and the consistent nature of our House style. The predominance of Pinot Noir provides the structure that is so typically Clicquot, while a touch of Pinot Meunier rounds out the blend. Chardonnay adds the elegance and finesse essential in a perfectly balanced wine.</li>
      <li>The house was founded in 1772 by Philippe Clicquot-Muiron
        <ul>
          <li>It was his son’s widow Madamoisele Nicole-Barbe Ponsardin who established the company as a supplier to the royal courts.
            <ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Grapes from as many as 50 to 60 different <em>Crus</em> go to the blending of Brut Yellow Label. The Cellar Master has to achieve the total consistency of taste, which makes Brut Yellow Label so immediately recognisable, so utterly reliable both in terms of quality, colour, and bouquet. He will draw on priceless reserve wines for the blend: from 25 to 35%, sometimes as much as 40% to ensure the continuity of the House style. Each of these older wines - perhaps nine years old - is kept separately to perserve the unique qualities of the vineyard and the vintage.</li>
      <li>The vineyards of Champagne are planted in 3 distinct areas south of the city of Reims.
        <ul>
          <li>The “Montagne de Reims” is predominately planted with Pinot Noir
            <ul>
              <li>This is the backbone of the Champagne blend</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The “Cote des Blancs” are chalky slopes south of the town of Epernay that are ideally suited for Chardonnay</li>
          <li>The “Vallee de la Marne” is dominated by Pinot Meunier which is more able to withstand the frosts that the area are susceptible to due to the grape’s later budding</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Profile:
    <ul>
      <li>Tasting Notes: First, Brut Yellow Label looks beautiful: golden-yellow, with a foaming necklace of tiny bubbles. Next it is so pleasing to the nose: initially reminiscent of white fruits and raisins, then of vanilla and later of brioche. Note the fine balance between the fruity aromas coming from the grape varieties and the toasty aromas following the ageing in the bottle. The first sip delivers all the freshness and forcefulness so typical of Yellow Label with asymphony of fruit tastes following on. Here is a true memeber of the powerful Brut family, well structured, admirably vinous. The lingering aromas echo and re-echo, with each fruit or spice note distinct.

      <li>Name of the Winery:</li>
      <li>Provenance: Our story began in 1971 when our parents, Susan Sokol and Bill Blosser, first planted vines in Oregon’s Dundee Hills.  As second generation winegrowers, we are passionately committed to our family’s legacy of creating world-class wines, through sustainable methods, which express our distinctive hillside vineyards.
        <ul>
          <li>We produce a dry style Pinot Gris which accentuates the minerality this varietal cleaerly expresses. In addition to fermentation size and temperature, the diversity of yeasts used to perform fermentation and the extended period of lees contact prior to blending and bottling contributes greatly to the complexity of this wine.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Region: 100% Willamette Valley AVA</li>
  <li>Grapes: 100% Pinot Gris
    <ul>
      <li>Grapes were carefully hand harvested at different points in ripeness, 21-24 degrees Brix, to capture variety of flavor profiles making this a more layered wine. When necessary, the clusters were sorted by hand to remove any flawed bunches. Our Pinot Gris is gently whole cluster pressed to minimize the extraction of bitterness from the skins.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Profile:
    <ul>
      <li>Tasting Notes: Our 2018 Willamette Valley is bright, refreshing, and full of interesting flavors. Strong aromas of elder flower, ripe pears, honeysuckle, and slight hint of Armenian cucumber combine to create a captivating bouquet. On the palate you will experience flavors of ripe melon, lime zest, and lemon pith. This delightful wine finishes crisp with hints of green apple and fresh honeydew melon.

          <li><strong>Duke’s Blurb</strong> → When Susan Sokol and Bill Blosser planted their first vines in the Dundee Hills AVA (American Viticultural Area) of the Willamette Valley in 1971, there was no wine industry in Oregon. Today, with over 900 wineries and more than 37,000 acres of planted vineyards, Oregon has grown exponentially and its wines are available throught the world. Sokol Blosser has survived, grown, and prospered as a family-owned and run operation, and their certified organic 89-acre property is now inspiring their 3rd generation.</li>

      <li>Points of Distinction: The spring of 2018 wqas warmer than the average over the previous 10 years, and fairly dry. Bud break happened in mid-April and Bloom in early June, which can be a treacherous undertaking as the spring weather can mess up a healthy flowering. A giant hail storm descended on the Dundee Hills in early June, but luckily none of our Sokol Blosser Estate crop was ruined. The summer started like one giant furnace; July was a hot month and we had a lot of above 90 degree days. Just when it seemed like the hot weather would not stop, August came and mroe moderate weather with it.  This helped slow the ripening down and even cooler weather in September allowed us to let the grapes hang longer, resulting in riper fruit without additional sugar accumulation. The 2018 vintage is our coolest growing season since 2012 and we believe it will be our best vintage since then as well.

          <li>The juice was chilled and allowed to settle for 2 days, then moved off the heavy sediment and transferred to stainless steel fermentation tanks. The Pinot Gris is aged in stainless steel vessels to retain and emphasize delicate floral and fruit aromatics. Additionally, we want to maintain bright acidity in our style of pinot gris so we do not push this wine thru malolactic (or secondary) fermentation. The wine remained in contact with its fine lees and stirred multiple times during the aging process to broaden the palate and develop weight without high alcohol or sugar. This 2018 blend is made entirely from Sokol Blosser estate grown fruit.</li>

      <li>Provenance: The Russian River Valley is an ideal spot to grow Sauvignon Blanc. Warm days and cool nights allow the grapes to hold onto their natural acidity. While 2019 was our last wet growing season, with three “atmospheric rivers” in May, it did not affect the Sauvignon Blanc flowering or set. It did produce very vigorous vine growth, which led us to be proactive with our canopy management in order to get the ripe tropical flavors we aim for in our Sauvignon Blanc.</li>

        <p>Provenance:  LIOCO was conceived in the alley behind Spago Beverly Hills by wine director Kevin O’Connor and wine salesman Matt Licklider. The two colleagues, critical of the heavy-handed wines of the day, wondered if it were possible to make some local wines that favored nuance over sheer power. In 2005, relying on nothing more than their palates and their rolodexes, the two embarked on a winemaking odyssey.  Europe was the inspiration, as were the more restrained California wines of the 1980’s.</p>

        <p>Today the winery is owned and operated by the Licklider family. Husband/wife duo Matt and Sara Licklider and their small team produce the wines at a state-of-the-art winemaking cooperative in Santa Rosa.  All of the fruit is purchased from exceptional vineyards spanning 200-miles and three counties (Santa Cruz, Sonoma, and Mendocino).</p>

This has been our approach since Day 1 despite real incentives to conform to a more commercial style.   - **The Lioco Way**

      <li>Points of Distinction: <strong>Notes</strong> The challenges in the 2020 vintage were formidable but not impossible. Pandemic aside, it was the widespread fires that necessitated loose knees. Several of our vineyard were exposed to periods of hazy air from fires in neighboring counties. The distance from these fires ultimately proved to be the saving grace.  The lab kept sending us back clean samples, and theories emerged about vineyards being relatively safe provided the fires originated far away. To be extra caustious, we triaged every load of fruit and employed winemaking protocols honed in the 2008 fire vintage, so… early harvest dates, light pressings, multiple rackings to get juice off skins, and gentle extractions on the reds. You’ve already seen our 2020 Rosé of Carignan + 2020 Mendocino Pinot Noir, which should tell you what you need to know about LIOCO’s 2020 cuvees. The story we should be tellind is about dramatic drought-concentration of the 2020 wines. Tiny crop, hot and dry year, minituraized cluster sizes, and winemaking protocols that produced very low juice yields, but remarkably dense wines.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Name of the Winery: Stuhlmuller Vineyards</li>
      <li>Provenance: <strong>The Vintage</strong> → Following a cool, mild growing season, an August heat spell accelerated ripening, resulting in an earlier start to harvest than normal. Our vineyard set an average size crop, and thanks to a full canopy, we had ideal shade on the fruit. As a result, our vines produced pristine grapes, with excellent natural acidity, lovely balance, and pure varietal flavors. We harvested our 2020 Chardonnay from August 18th through September 2nd with average brix of 22.5 degrees.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Region: Alexander Valley
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vineyards</strong> → Stuhlmuller Vineyrds, located in souther Alexander Valley, converges with two highly regarded Sonoma County appellations, Chalk Hill and Russian Rivver Valley. On its eastern edge, the 150-acre vineyard borders the Russian River. Situated in a location that is part river benchlands and part hillside, the vineyard benefits from its alluvial gravel soils and the rockier soils of the hillside sections.</li>

  <li>Grapes: 100% Chardonnay
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clones</strong> → The famous Upper Barn clone, one of California’s most sought-after Chardonnay selections, comprises 85% of the grapes that went into the 2020 Estate Chardonnay blend. The balance is from the Wente/FPS72 clone. From the Upper Barn clone, this wine derives flavors of Asian pear, spice, and a natural nuttiness, while the small clusters and berries of the Wente clone contribute concentrated tropical flavors.</li>

      <li>Name of the Winery: Domaine Michel Gros</li>
      <li>Provenance: <strong>Localisation</strong> → This vineyard, which is planted next to the Pinot Noir parcel is trained exactly the same way. The soil, which is mainly composed of <em>marl</em> in this area, is perfectly suitable for Chardonnay. The pruning used here is Guyot simple. It is located at an altitude reaching 360m to 380m, on so-called “Pernand marls”. This geological stratum, that is also present in Pernand-Vergelesses and the hill of Corton, explains the similarity with wines from these vineyard areas, the altitude bringing in a little more freshness.

          <li>Collection of vineyards</li>
          <li><strong>Vintage 2018</strong> → 2018 is an early-harvest vintage marked by a spring and summer that were very hot and dry, resulting in very complete ripeness and perfectly healthy grapes.</li>
          <li>After a relatively mild and rainy winter 2017-2018, the cool, damp start of spring forecast a rather late harvest. The return of hot weather in April changed all that and the vines then set off growing very rapidly through to the end of summer. At the domain, the whole team had to double their efforts to keep up with the very active vine growth. Vine-flowering passed off perfectly from end May, announcing a harvest at the very beginning of September. The rainfall shortage in spring and summer did not pose a major problem for our vines, probably thanks to water reserves accumulated during the winter. Rain storms in the month of July allowed the vines to reach perfect ripemess at the beginning of September. Unfortunately, the storms on 3rd and 15th July provoked outbreaks of hail that seriously impacted on our sector the Hautes-Cotes de Nuits (average loss of crop at 50%) and our parcel of ‘Les Chaliots’ located in Nuits-Saint-Georges (loss of around 30%)</li>
          <li>We began harvesting on 4th September on the ‘Cote’ and finished on 17th September in the Hautes-Cotes. Grape healthiness was absolutely perfect and sorting was virtually unnecessary. Only the crop from hail-damaged parcels had to be very carefully sorted and we were lucky to be able to use an optical grape sorter to removre grapes damaged by hail.</li>
          <li>This relatively early date of harvest and the perfect grape healthiness led to production of wines of great purity with beautiful freshness and bursting with fruit. The vintage already promises to be a very good one for laying down.</li>

      <li>Name of the Winery: Chateau Montelena (est 1882)</li>
      <li>Provenance: <strong>Notes from the Winemaker</strong> → “I remember standing at the press as the <em>first squeeze</em> from  our first lot of Chardonnay in 2019 began to trickle into the pan . . . and thinking WOW. Even at 6am and at that stage – cold juice scarcely 2 hours removed from the vine – it was clear that the potential for an effusive, rich, complex wine was there. The excitement lasted scarcely 10 seconds before it was time to get to work; time to envision, time to make (irreversible) decisions, and time to act. Seeing the potential, the mosaic in our minds, is one thing. Being naturally curious and receptive to new, creative ideas is another. But it’s in the translation, the execution, and the eventual realization of what’s finally in the glass that’s the greates challenge yet ultimately the most gratifying.” – Matt Crafton
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vintage Weather</strong> → Plentiful winter rains coupled with cool temperatures pushed budbreak slightly behind normal. However, the vines took full advantage of the abundant soil moisture and responded with bountiful growth as the weather warmed into June. Mild summer days with temperatures dipping into the 50s at night made for ideal ripening conditions as harvest approached on time. A shot of heat in early September pushed the early blocks over the finish line, although cool temperatures mid-month drew the Chardonnay harvest out over 18 days.</li>

      <li>Tasting Notes:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nose</strong> → Bright gold in color and incredibly aromatic, the ripeness of the vintage is most pronounce initially; melon, perfume, and orange blossom slowly give way to fresh peach, honeysuckle, and apricot. There’s very little overt oak influence on the nose, although it comes across subtly in the background as pie crust and toast.</li>
          <li><strong>Palate</strong> → It’s the suppleness and silky mouthfeel that strike first, although there’s abundant mango and citrus with Meyer lemon here as well. The minerality is chalky and distinct, a beautiful contrast that layers in with the in with the acid adding both complexity and depth.</li>
          <li><strong>Finish</strong> → There’s slightly more wood on the transition to the finish, surfacing as baking spice and creme brulee. However, they’re handily overwhelmed by notes of Asian pear, mango, and pineapple – absolutely delicious. In time, expect hazelnut and almond to appear.</li>
          <li><strong>Duke’s Flavors</strong> → Meyer Lemon, Mango, Mineral</li>
          <li><strong>Duke’s Blurb</strong> → The Montelena property is located near Clistoga, in the northernmost part of Napa Valley and goes back to 1882. It has been owned by the Barrett family since 1972. Jim Barrett gained fame for winning the Judgment of Paris with his 1973 Chardonnay and helped to earn American wines international attention and respect. Their winemaking style has not changed since and they craft a very classic (some might say old-world) style of wine.</li>

Cool, mild Spring conditions continued after budbreak, followed by light May rains, just enough to keep soils moist without affecting fruit set. Summer was slow and steady, and the moderate weather coupled with the natural groundwater supply allowed for vigorous, healthy vine growth well into late summer. The firset signs of veraison occurred in late July followed by a month of steady ripening that was punctuated by a short heat spike in mid-August. We started picking fruit just after the Labor Day holiday, and all of the Chardonnay that came into the winery possessed fresh, mouthwatering acidity and balanced ripeness.

      <li>Name of the Winery:</li>
      <li>Provenance: The brilliant work of Santa Barbara’s über-talented, second-generation vintners has become unavoidable: These wines have serious international clout, they’ve dismantled Premier and Grand Cru Burgundies in blind tastings … a new project springs up every fortnight … [hard] to find the diamonds.
  Piro is one of those diamonds, and our white-hot enthusiasm during our tasting convinced us this will be a must-watch name in the coming years… wine critic Antonio Galloni …claim[ed] that “Marc Piro is one of Santa Barbara’s most promising young Pinot producers.” That ringing endorsement is fully confirmed in today’s 2018 “Points West” Pinot Noir. It’s packed with a velvet-gloved punch to turn around any lingering naysayers and double-loaded with terroir and elegance for lifelong Pinot disciples.”
        <ul>
          <li>After graduating from college, Marc Piro knew one of the few jobs he could land that required no previous winemaking experience was working the night shift at a behemoth custom-crush facility in Gisborne, New Zealand. Pressing endless tons of bulk-grade Sauvignon Blanc was hardly glamorous but it carved the first notch on his winemaking belt. From there, he jetted down to South Island stronghold Villa Maria to catch a second harvest that same year (2011). He was back to the States just in time to jump in the harvest operations at Thacher Vineyards in Paso Robles. It was here that Sherman Thacher introduced him to famed Argentine grower, Santiago Achával, who was collaborating on a new Paso Robles venture, so the following year found him working harvest at Achával-Ferrer in Mendoza. Writing a winning essay sponsored by UC Davis’ Enology/Viticulture Department landed him an internship with Santa Maria Valley gurus Jim Clendenen (Au Bon Climat) and Bob Lindquist (Qupé). Once that yearlong gig was up, he squeezed in another Southern Hemisphere harvest at Vasse Felix. Marc’s desire to settle down somewhere on the Central Coast serendipitously coincided with the need for an assistant winemaker back at Clendenen’s home base. He’s been there ever since, and 2021 will be Marc’s tenth harvest at Au Bon Climat / Qupé. To this day, it’s where he crafts his eponymous label, starting with just two barrels of Pinot Noir in 2014.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In Northern Santa Barbara County, the Santa Maria Valley is producing some of the greatest Pinot Noir on the planet. Thanks to a specific microclimate, made possible by the unique, east-west cooling effects of the <strong>Transverse Ranges</strong> off the coast of the Pacific, this distinct region of California delivers a Burgundian expression much like the best of Oregon, with slightly more texture and explosive fruit. The appellation’s well-situated vineyards and moderate temperatures result in the ideal, trifecta combination found in top-tier Pinot Noir: ripeness, tension, and aromatic complexity.
  For this impressive 2018 Piro “Points West” cuvée, Marc blends two ultra-premium Pinot Noir sites inthe Santa Maria Valley: Presqu’ile and Runway.
        <ul>
          <li>Presqu’ile → located 15 miles east of the Pacific ocean, it sits on ancient dunes and these sandy soils create elegant wines with high-toned aromatics, structure, and minerality. The farming here is sustainable and hyper-vigilant.</li>
          <li>Runway vineyard shares its property line with the western edge of the Bien Nacido Estate, arguably the most famous vineyard in the United States. Planted in 2008 with high-grade clonal selections, Runway’s Pinot Noir vines are rooted in sandy topsoils packed with significant amounts of clay, providing more “flesh and opulent, mid-palate fruit” to this wine according to Marc. He adds, “I’d say Runway has cooler nights and Presqu’ile has cooler days.” Capturing the best of both worlds, he blended 58% Runway fruit with 42% Presqu’ile in this 2018.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Grapes: Hand-harvested, hand-sorted and 100% de-stemmed, today’s 2018 Piro Points West Pinot Noir was fermented in open-top tanks through a 14-day maceration period. The two vineyard lots were fermented and aged separately. Afterward, the wine was pressed and put in French Oak barrels. The wine remained in barrel, aging for 21 months prior to a final blending and unfiltered bottling.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Tasting Notes: Bristling with energy, this remarkable effor possesses a striking purity of fruit and exceptional balance. In the glass, it reveals a deep ruby-garnet hue with magenta highlights toward the rim. An enchanting uppter register of aromatics jumps forward with vivid red berry fruit, kola nut, ripe cherry, blood orange, baking spice, dried flowers, and anise.
  The medium-bodied palate hums with verve, ripeness, and intensity before finishing with a commanding, chiseled freshness. Over the course of an hour, Piro’s 2018 “Points West” slowly revealed layer after nuanced layer.

          <li><strong>Duke’s Blurb</strong> → Marc Piro knew he wanted to be a winemaker when he was 9 years old. He sat in the crowded backseat of his family’s station wagon as they drove through the vineyards of Sonoma’s Dry Creek Valley, and, inspired, he announced, “Mom, I want a vineyard.” Her response was curt, “Well, then, get a good job.” He now works with the Au Bon Climat and Qupé wineries in Santa Maria, with Jim Clendenen and Bob Lindquist, two of the legendary names of Santa Barbar County. He also had a pretty legendary roommate in college, Mr Rob Thibaut!</li>

  <li>Producer
    <ul>
      <li>Name of the Winery: Truchard Vineyards</li>
      <li>Provenance: 2019 is very similar to the near-perfect 2018 vintage. A cold winter with average rainfall made for a late bud-break. Ideal spring weather allowed for nice berry set and above average yields. Mild conditions throughout summer and fall allowed the fruit to slowly ripen and develop maximum flavor.  The wines of 2019 are bold and intenser with nice structure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Region: Carneros, CA
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vineyard</strong> → Seven separate clonal selections of Pinot Noir grow on the Truchard Estate Vineyard. Two “Martini” clones, the “Pommard” clone, the “Swan” clone and several new selections from france – Dijon 114, 115, 667, 777. Each selection provides a unique element of aromatic fruit, spice, and texture to the blend. The vines range from 23-45 years in age. They are planted in several select sites that take full advantage of the thin soils, rolling hills, and cooler temperatures, factors which combine to make the Carneros region ideal for producing Pinot Noir.

          <li><strong>Winemaking</strong> → All of the fruit was gently destemmed and crushed into open top fermenters with approximately 20% whole berries. Each lot was inoculated with Assmannhausen yeast, after “cold soaking” for up to 5 days. Fermentations were punched down three times daily with the temperature peaking at 92˚F. After 7 - 12 days of maceration, the lots were pressed, settled in tanks for 24 hours, and then put into barrel. This wine was aged for 10 months in French oak (35% new), and bottled in August of 2020. It is ready for immediate drinking, but will gracefully age for the next 12-15 years.</li>

      <li>Name of the Winery: Williams Selyem</li>
      <li>Provenance: <strong>Harvest</strong> → The 2020 growing season started out very dry and bud break was delayed. Early spring rains recharged with soil profile, but periods of extreme cold caused many frost events throughout the Russian River Valley. Late spring yielded ample sunshine and moderate temperatures, and the plants responded very well with excellent canopy growth. The season ended up approximately 12% warmer than average and did not have any heat spikes until August. Harvest started in haste on August 12, ahead of an extreme heat wave. On the night of August 17, the weather changed and there was a rare dry lightning storm that sparked a fire on a hillside in remote west Sonoma County; later named the Walbridge Fire. In the Russian River Valley, it took a number of days for smoke to settle. Based on test results for smoke tain on the grapes, several coastal vineyards were not picked. For the vineyards which were picked, either before the fire or before the smoke settled, the result was concentrated wines with a darker, more brooding complexion. The polish of the tannin, coupled with excellent concentration, should allow for a wide drinking window.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Region:

      <li>The Pinot Noir for this blend was sourced from the following vineyards: Bucher, Falstaff, Foss, Hallberg, and Laguna.</li>

      <li>Tasting Notes: Strawberry and red fruits jump from the glass in this multifaceted wine. Complexed with notes of sassafras and bergamot, aromas of dried rose petal are layered in the nose and offer up classic Pinot Noir perfume. In the mouth, the wine has a sense of roundness and harmony that is satisfying and refreshing. Dark red fruit flavors mix with hints of cocoa and wood spices. Sourced from various vineyards in the Russian River Valley including some younger blocks from the various Estate vineyards.

          <li><strong>Duke’s Flavors</strong> → Black Cherry, Blackberry, cinnamon, dark chocolate</li>
          <li><strong>Duke’s Blurb</strong> → Williams Selyem Winery began as a simple dream of two friends, Ed Selyem and Burt Williams, who started weekend winemaking as a hobby in 1979 in a garage in Forestville, California. It took less than two decades from their first commercial vintage in 1981 for Burt and Ed to create a cult-status winery of international acclaim. Together, they set a new standard for Pinot Noir winemaking in the United States, raising Sonoma County’s Russian River Valley to among the best winegrowing regions in the world. The Pinot Noir for this blend was sourced from four unique sties along Eastside Road: Foss Vineyard, Calegari Vineyard, Hunt Ryd Vineyard, and Lone Oak Vineyards</li>

      <li>Provenance: Though its core still revolves around the Sonoma Valley appellation (Bedrock Vineyard, Monte Rosso, and Casa Santinamaria Vineyard), we have become geographically more adventurous due to the addition of a few pretty amaazing vineyards. The first of these is Nervo Ranch in Alexander Valley with its steep, decomposed shale soils. The second is Sodini Ranch on Limerick Lane in the Russian River Valley that Bedrock Wine Co happily farms. The last is the amazing Stampede Vineyard in the Clements Hills AVA of Lodi: own-rooted on granitic sands and planted in 1919, it is a star in the making under the new ownership of the Perlegos family.

Years later Morgan started Bedrock and devoted himself to saving some of the oldest vineyards in the state. This bottling is a blend of fruit from ‘ancient’vines’, some of which are over 100 years old and averaging over 80 years old! The drawing on the label is of an old, gnarly Zinfandel vine. There is a small raven on one of the limbs as a tribute to his dad. These old vineyards were often planted as ‘field blends’ with several different grape varieteies mixed within the same row.</li>

      <li>Provenance: K Vintners is Charles Smith’s Rhone-focused label and the one that has garnered him the highest scores (including multiple 100-pts). In fact, this Syrah just received 98 points! From Charles: “Considering I only made single vineyard Syrah, like I still do, I didn’t know what to write on the barrel,” he laughed. “Well, resting on one of the barrels was my cat, a tabby. She had an “M” on her forehead, so I’d named her Motor City Kitty ‘cause she was such a rock &amp; roll cat. I wrote her name on that barrel so I wouldn’t forget which one it was, and thus the wine was named for my very Detroit tabby cat, MCK.”</li>

      <li>MCK is sustainably grown on legendary Washington vineyard operator Dick Boushey’s Oldfield Block, which was planted with help from our own winemaker, Brennon Leighton. Coming from high elevation and sandy, volcanic soils, MCK is still crafted from three distinct Syrah clones to make one of our longest running wines.</li>

      <li>Provenance: The 2019 vintage was on the cooler side as it started slow with later-than-usual bud break and continued on to be fairly moderate throughout the year. Some vineyards had issues with an October freeze a bit earlier than usual, but our high-elevation vineyards have great air drainage which allows us to extend the growing seqason late into October without freeze. This yielded fantastic ripening and some awesome wines with incredible balance and character. Overall, we are excited about the wine produced in 2019, which has brought us more finesse, incredible flavors and lovely balance.</li>

It’s no simple fruit bomb and has notable structure, ripe tannins, and outstanding length. It reminds me of a top Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux and represents a stunning value.

      <li>Name of the Winery: DAOU</li>
      <li>Provenance: 2018 may go in history as the longest season yet. A good amount of rain fell in the region which gave to a later bud break in April. The vines were energized by the much needed moisture, setting one of our best crops yet. The weather remained steady from spring through June. Then we received a long heat wave that fortunately did not affect the quality of the grapes due to the fact that it was before the start of veraison. A cooling trend ensued for the rest of the season right after the heatwave, prolonging the hang time leading into harvest. The long hang time yielded deep color and concentration with dense wines. The tannins are silky and beautifully integrated. As a result, 2018 was an exceptional vintage that really highlights the aromatics and acidity of the wines.</li>

      <li>Tasting Notes: The 2018 vintage shows characteristics that are rich and sophisticated on the nose with currant, black cherry, cedar, and eucalyptus and displays undertones of briary blackberry and wet gravel. Ancillary aromas of coffee and cocoa are rounded out nicely with notes of crushed sage and baking spice. Full bodied and formidable on the palate, offering enticing juicy wild blackberry, Oregon blueberry, and crisp black cherry flavors. Hints of plum and mulberry are accentuated with fig, black olives, and fine leather. Excellent structure and harmony between the pure fruit core and firm, supple backbone of polished tannins. Finish is surprisingly elegant for a wine of such power. Silky and smooth, ending on lovely notes of sweet cherry and boysenberry.

      <li>Provenance: Established in 2002, Cliff Lede Vineyards encompasses sixty acres in the famed Stags Leap District. Founder Cliff Lede, Director of Vineyard Operations Allison Wilson, and Director of Winemaking Christopher Tynan have come together to form an unrivaled team, making the most of this remarkable property.
        <ul>
          <li>Vineyards are named after Rock &amp; Roll songs</li>
          <li><strong>Vintage</strong> → The 2019 vinttage was a magnificent year for Napa Valley. A frost-free and uniform bud break was followed by a cool wet spring that included three inches of rain in May. Luckily, the rain didn’t affect set and the weather turned warm and sunny for the duration of spring. Welcome warm nights in June, July, and August caught maturation back on schedule. Summer conditions were moderate, with warm days and cool nights, ideal for slow and steady grape maturation. The wine shows exceptional balance with concentrated, ripe fruit complemented by bright acidity and supple, yet intense, structure. Optimal ripeness was achieved thanks to an early autumn of consistently warm, but not hot, days. The pristine ripening conditions allowed for very intense fruit flavor concentrations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Region: Stags Leap District
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vineyards</strong> → The fruit was sourced from the hillside terrace of our Poetry Vineyard, our Twin Peaks Vineyard estate surrounding the winery, and a few neighboring vineyards in the Stags Leap District. The wine is composed of small lots from our best blocks, representing a diverse range of carefully selected clones and rootstocks. From Poetry’s exposed, rocky terraces boasting volcanic origins, to the ancient riverbed alluvial soils of Twin Peaks, the breadth of contributing sites translates into a wine of impressive complexity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Grapes: 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Winemaking</strong> → Grapes were picked in the darkness of the early morning hours. The freshly-harvested fruit immediately underwent rigorous selection by our three-tiered sorting process, which included our cutting-edge optical sorter. Whole berries were gently delivered by gravity to tank using our crane system, minimuzing disruption of berry integrity. Cold soaks lasted approximately seven days, and fermentations were managed via a combination of <em>délestage</em>, pumpovers, and punchdowns. Extended maceration ranging from four to five weeks fine-tuned our tannin profiles, allowing us to perfect mouth feel and wine complexity.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Tasting Notes: “The essence of our proud Stags Leap District terroir in a glass, the 2019 vintage produced a delicious wine of purity, warmth, and grace. Built on a foundation of lush cassis, blackberry, and dark cherry aromas, this long and full-boduied wine is apportioned with a perfume of cardamom, clove, and ancho chile. Graphite, chocolate cake, crushed mulberries, and grilled steak notes make an appearance along the way and add to a long and complex finish” – <em>Christopher Tynan, Director of Winemaking</em>

          <li><strong>Vintage Description</strong> → Mother Nature made a memorable impression on the 2017 vintage. In January we welcomed epic winter rains that brought an end to the enduring five-year drought. The generous precipitation filled our water tables and woke up the vines. After an average bud break, prolific shoot and vegetation growth early in the season required close observation and much weed control and leafing to open the dense canopies. Bloom proceeded at a steady pace and set us up for a healthy crop size. In June and July, three extended heat events tested our vineyard team and culminated with high temperatures around Labor Day. While the hot weather kick-started harvest on September 4, our irrigation management and cooler, foggy mornings allowed the vines to recover and resume their trajectory towards full aromatic and phsyiological ripeness. We were happy to see sugars and acids at normal levels. The pace of harvest was steady and we had thankfully finished picking before the wildfires started on the night of October 8. While 2017 certainly presented its share of challenges, it was also the jubilant, inaugural vintage for our new, state-of-the-art facility we had been planning, designing, and building since we purchased the Alexander Valley property in 2012.</li>
