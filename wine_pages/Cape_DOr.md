## Provenance
### Winery
The concept of Cape D’Or came to life when Ernst Storm, Tiaan Bezuidenhout, and Parker Wittbrodt who all live in Santa Barbara County came together and enjoyed a bottle of South African wine. Sitting around a kitchen table with a glass in hand, they reminisced about their time spent in South Africa and the exceptional wines from the Western Cape. With twenty+ years of experience in the wine and hospitality industries, they knew that these unique, high-quality South African wines needed to be shared with other wines enthusiasts.

### Region
**Swartland, South Africa**
**Vineyard Notes** → Dry land farmed, low cropping vineyards. Vine-age of 23 years. Heavy Shale soils with high percentage of clay. 450ft above sea level.

### Winemaking 
The fruit for this Cabernet Sauvignon was sourced from sustainable, dry land vineyards in South Africa. These vineyards are located in the Western Cape region of South Africa where cool afternoon breezes allow for favorable ripening conditions. Working with fruit from some of the oldest deposits of granite and shale soils on the planet allow for a balance between old world texture and new world freshness.
