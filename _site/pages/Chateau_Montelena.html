<p>Established in 1882
<strong>Notes from the Winemaker</strong> → “I remember standing at the press as the <em>first squeeze</em> from our first lot of Chardonnay in 2019 began to trickle into the pan . . . and thinking WOW. Even at 6am and at that stage — cold juice scarcely 2 hours removed from the vine — it was clear that the potential for an effusive, rich, complex wine was there. The excitement lasted scarcely 10 seconds before it was time to get to work; time to envision, time to make (irreversible) decisions, and time to act. Seeing the potential, the mosaic in our minds, is one thing. Being naturally curious and receptive to new, creative ideas is another. But it’s in the translation, the execution, and the eventual realization of what’s finally in the glass that’s the greates challenge yet ultimately the most gratifying.” — Matt Crafton</p>

<p><strong>Napa Valley, California</strong>
The Montelena property is located near Clistoga, in the northernmost part of Napa Valley and goes back to 1882. It has been owned by the Barrett family since 1972. Jim Barrett gained fame for winning the Judgment of Paris with his 1973 Chardonnay and helped to earn American wines international attention and respect. Their winemaking style has not changed since and they craft a very classic (some might say old-world) style of wine.</p>

<p><strong>Vintage Weather</strong> → Plentiful winter rains coupled with cool temperatures pushed budbreak slightly behind normal. However, the vines took full advantage of the abundant soil moisture and responded with bountiful growth as the weather warmed into June. Mild summer days with temperatures dipping into the 50s at night made for ideal ripening conditions as harvest approached on time. A shot of heat in early September pushed the early blocks over the finish line, although cool temperatures mid-month drew the Chardonnay harvest out over 18 days.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>See</strong> →  Bright gold in color</li>
  <li><strong>Smell</strong> → incredibly aromatic, the ripeness of the vintage is most pronounce initially; melon, perfume, and orange blossom slowly give way to fresh peach, honeysuckle, and apricot. There’s very little overt oak influence on the nose, although it comes across subtly in the background as pie crust and toast.</li>
  <li><strong>Sip</strong> → It’s the suppleness and silky mouthfeel that strike first, although there’s abundant mango and citrus with Meyer lemon here as well. The minerality is chalky and distinct, a beautiful contrast that layers in with the in with the acid adding both complexity and depth.
    <ul>
      <li>Meyer lemon, Mango, Mineral</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Savor</strong> → There’s slightly more wood on the transition to the finish, surfacing as baking spice and creme brulee. However, they’re handily overwhelmed by notes of Asian pear, mango, and pineapple — absolutely delicious. In time, expect hazelnut and almond to appear.</li>
