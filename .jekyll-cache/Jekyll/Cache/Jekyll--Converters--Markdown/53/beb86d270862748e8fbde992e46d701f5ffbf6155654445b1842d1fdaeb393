<p>Now here‚Äôs the bread and butter of what we as servers and bartenders do . . . we make sure that the meals the guests have exceeds their expectations and we can help that by helping them choose a wine that they will enjoy.</p>

<p>But that means literally understanding the different components of our wines and how they match up against each other.  Most of the time we end up just reciting a word or phrase from the tech sheets that we can remember, but hopefully you‚Äôll find some ways on this page that will explain things better for you.</p>

<p>The biggest thing to remember as you read this is that <strong>tasting wine is <em>subjective</em></strong>, meaning that what you taste might not be the same things your guests or even your spouse tastes when they get into the wine.  Some of that has to do with genetics (just like 16% of us in the world knows that Cilantro tastes like soap whereas the rest of you savages actually like that devil-herb), but you can train your senses to better appreciate wine.</p>

<h2 id="wtf-is-a-taste-bud">WTF is a ‚ÄúTaste Bud‚Äù</h2>
<h3 id="taste-papillae"><i>Taste Papillae</i></h3>
<p>Ok, I honestly believed that the bumps on our tongues were the actual taste buds.  Turns out they‚Äôre not.  Those bumps are actually called <em>taste papillae</em>, and they contain many sensory cells that end up looking like a peeled orange with all its sections arranged around the center.  In the very middle at the top of the taste papillae is a small indention that acts like a funnel into the center of the taste papillae. When we put something in our mouth, the chemical substances responsible for taste fill that indention.
There are 3 types of papillae that contain several taste buds with sensory cells:</p>
<h4 id="fungiform-papillae">Fungiform Papillae</h4>
<p>These are the most common.  We have between 200 to 400 of these bumps spread all over the surface of the tongue, although these are found mostly at the tip of the tongue and at the edges.  This is why those areas are especially sensitive to taste.   The fungiform papillae not only detect taste, they contain sensory cells for touch and temperature.
Each of these contain between 3 to 5 taste buds.</p>
<h4 id="circumvallate-papillae">Circumvallate Papillae</h4>
<p>These are very large papillae that are found in a V-shape at the back of the tongue.  You can see them with the naked eye (they look round and raised.) They‚Äôre called circumvallate papillae because they are surrounded by a trench containing many glands that ‚Äúrinse‚Äù the taste-producing substances into the sensory cells.<br />
Each of these contain several THOUSANDS of taste buds.</p>
<h4 id="foliate-papillae">Foliate Papillae</h4>
<p>These are located on the rear edges of the tongue and can also be seen with the naked eye.  They can be seen as several folds that lie close together.  Our tongues have about 20 foliate papillae.
Each of these contain several hundreds of taste buds.</p>

<h2 id="taste-vs-flavor">Taste vs Flavor</h2>
<p>We don‚Äôt actually <em>taste</em> the flavor of our food and wine.  <strong>Flavor</strong>is actually how our brain interprets the combination of what we smell with our nose with what we taste and feel with our mouth.  What we smell through our <em>olfactory nerves</em> interacts with what we sense through the taste buds on our tongues to give us a flavor to whatever‚Äôs in our mouth.</p>

<p>Genetics determines how many taste buds our tongues have, and those with more taste buds are called super-tasters.  Sadly, some people are just born with more or less taste buds than others.  The good news is that whatever taste buds you have will regenerate every 10-30 days if you hurt them.  That‚Äôs why you gain that sense of taste back a few days after drinking that ridiculously hot coffee.</p>

<p>Genetics also determines how those  taste buds perceive bitterness.  One study had pregnant mothers drink a glass of carrot juice a day for two weeks and discovered that the mothers who liked drinking the carrot juice had babies that enjoyed carrots whereas the mothers who didn‚Äôt normally drink carrot juice but did for the study ended up with kids who disliked carrots.  Super-tasters tend to fall in that second category.</p>

<p>But while tasting is a genetic trait that shows up in our world by our sixth month of living, the smells we recognize are a learned experience. You can train yourself to recognize more smells as well as you can numb yourself to particular smells.  That‚Äôs why the smelly kid in 2nd grade never actually knew he was smelly . . . his body adapted to stop smelling that weird smell of oatmeal and cat that overtook the classroom.</p>

<p>Humans can detect up to 10,000 different odors, at amazingly small amounts. Gas companies add a trace amount of a nasty smell to natural gas so we can detect a leak long before it becomes dangerous. We can smell that at 2 parts per billion.</p>

<p>But we can go even further with smell since there are some compounds we can smell at 1 part per trillion and lower.  Those include green bell pepper, mold, roasted oats, and boiled seafood.</p>

<p>We are able to smell through two different routes, our nose and the back of our mouth.  Sniffing through the nose is called <em>orthonasal smell</em>. The aroma you get through the back of your mouth is your <em>retronasal smell</em>.</p>

<p>So when you look to tasting wine, it‚Äôs best to look at the different tastes or flavor profiles that our tongues can sense.</p>

<h2 id="5-basic-tastes-our-tongues-recognize-and-a-bonus">5 Basic Tastes our Tongues Recognize (and a bonus)</h2>
<p>Unless you think Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a Brontosaurus, then odds are you recognize that humans have evolved over millions of years.  And since we‚Äôve had to eat, even when our sense of smell was hampered by the smoke from our cave‚Äôs fire, we had to evolve a sense that could protect us from anything dangerous we put in our mouth.  Enter in your taste buds.</p>

<p>Since our ancient ancestors lived in a tropical forest-like environment, they spent a lot of time running around naked and eating leaves and vegetables.  They had to learn really quickly what may or may not be toxic, so we developed the ability to taste toxins and interpret it as ‚Äúbitter‚Äù.  That‚Äôs why a lot of vegetables taste bitter, they tend to contain an element that if we ate too much of it it would be toxic for us.</p>

<p>We learned that if you were going to listen to a snake and pick an apple off of a tree, through experimentation our tongues told us that if we bit into the apple too soon it would taste sour and tart whereas if we waited a bit for it to ripen then we‚Äôd taste a much sweeter apple full of natural sugars we‚Äôd need for energy. You know, in case the saber-toothed tiger whose cave we stole comes back.  You‚Äôre gonna want that energy as you run away.</p>

<p>Once they figured out how to team up and fight back against the predators, our ancestors started eating meat.  This gave us a source of protein, but it was only once we started cooking the meat or letting it age a little bit (you know, ferment so the sweet and sour interact), we discovered that savory Umami flavor.</p>

<p>Fat told us which foods were a great source of energy and fatty acids.  Bitterness told us which vegetables to stay away from.  We like salt to since the vegetables we eat lack natural sodium. Umami led us to alternate sources of protein and essential amino acids.  Our sense of taste evolved to detect non-volatile molecules that we cannot smell.</p>

<h4 id="sweet">Sweet</h4>
<p>This is the taste of natural sugars found in many fruits and honey.  This includes derivatives like fructose or lactose, and even other types of substances that activate the sensory cells that respond to sweetness (alcoholic drinks for example).</p>
<h4 id="salty">Salty</h4>
<p>The taste of sodium and chloride (salt crystals) and the mineral salts potassium and magnesium.</p>
<h4 id="sour">Sour</h4>
<p>The taste of acidic solutions like lemon juice and organic acids.  This sensation is caused by hydrogen ions, chemical symbol: H+, split off by an acid dissolved in a watery solution.</p>
<h4 id="bitter">Bitter</h4>
<p>The taste of 35 different proteins in the sensory cells that respond to bitter substances.</p>
<h4 id="umami-savory">Umami (Savory)</h4>
<p>The taste comes from protein building blocks (amino acids) found naturally in protein-rich foods like meats and cheeses as well as some vegetables and fruits like ripe tomatoes or asparagus, and the taste is somewhat similar to the taste of a meat broth.  This is the signal that the dish is rich in protein and tends to evoke pleasant emotions in most people. <br />
There are sensory cells specifically made for this taste and was discovered by a Japanese researcher around 1910.</p>
<h4 id="bonus---fat">Bonus  ‚Äî FAT</h4>
<p>People used to think that preference for fatty foods was based solely on their smell and texture, but newer research suggests that there are probably receptors specifically for fat.  It is caused by certain fatty acids that enzymes in the saliva split from fatty foods.</p>

<h2 id="wine-temperature">Wine Temperature</h2>
<p>Somewhere along the way, in one of the umpteen-million wine tastings I have participated in, one presenter said something that stuck in my mind: <em>‚ÄùRoom temperature wine doesn‚Äôt mean the room temperature in Texas. You‚Äôre looking for room temperature in 16th century France so more in your 60‚Äôs than in your 80‚Äôs, even for red wines.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Fun Fact: One of the first modern refrigerators was advertised as able to cool a bottle of champagne in 10 minutes.  Yup, wine is EVERYWHERE.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a little more complicated than that, but that speaks to a big truth. <strong><em>Wine Temperature Changes the Taste</em></strong>
<strong>Cold temperatures</strong> enhance the perception of bitterness.   This is why we serve sweet white wines chilled, to keep their sweetness in balance.
<strong>Warm temperatures</strong> increase the impact of sweetness and alcohol.</p>

<h3 id="wine-temp-recommendations">Wine Temp Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Notes on temp
    <ul>
      <li>Wine will warm up in the glass, so we always try to serve it a few degrees colder than the recommended drinking temp.</li>
      <li>A wine bottle will drop 4¬∞ every ten minutes in a standard refrigerator.
        <ul>
          <li>Likewise, a bottle will warm up 4¬∞ every ten minutes at room temperature (70¬∞)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>As wine warms, it releases aromas which greatly impacts taste.
        <ul>
          <li>To taste the difference, take a bottle of Chardonnay and pour a glass</li>
          <li>Put that glass back in the fridge while you let the bottle warm up to 45¬∞</li>
          <li>Now pour a glass and smell that one
            <ul>
              <li>Pull the one out of the fridge and smell it</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Then compare the taste of the two</li>

<h2 id="are-you-a-super-taster">Are you a ‚ÄúSuper-Taster‚Äù?</h2>
<p>First thing you need to figure out is <strong> how much of your food do you taste?</strong>  A professor at the University of Florida (Go Vols!) named Linda Bartoshuk came up with the terms <strong>super-tasters</strong> and <strong>non-tasters</strong> while she was studying the genetic differences of taste.</p>

<p>What she discovered was that about 25% of the population is extremely sensitive to the taste of bitter tasting chemical  (6-n-propylthiouracil or PROP) and 25-30% of the population couldn‚Äôt even taste it, leaving about 45-50% of the population as <strong>average-tasters</strong>.</p>

<p>The 25% of the population that was extremely sensitive to the PROP cringed at even the smallest amount and she called these the <strong>super-tasters</strong>.  Turns out this group have many more visible <strong>papillae</strong> or <em>taste buds</em> than everyone else, meaning that they have many more taste cells with receptors for bitter taste.  It also means that they are more sensitive to the other basic tastes, just not as much.  <em>Because they can taste so much more, they tend to be very picky eaters</em>. Super-tasters tend to not like hot, spicy foods because the taste cells are surrounded by pain receptors therefore they also have more pain receptors than average and non-tasters.  Super-tasters tend to eat less vegetables since a lot of vegetables have a bitter taste, as well as they tend to prefer sweet, high-fat foods a lot less than average tasters.  They seem to not like alcohol as much and are less likely to smoke than the others.</p>

<p>Average tasters tend to like most foods, and they don‚Äôt really find the need to cover their food with salt or sriracha.</p>

<p>Non-tasters very much prefer high-fat, sweeter foods.  They also tend to drink more alcohol than the other two categories.</p>

<h3 id="test-which-you-are">Test Which You are</h3>
<p>In order to figure out whether you‚Äôre a super-taster, an average-taster, or a non-taster like I am, there‚Äôs a great little test you can do.</p>

<h4 id="equipment">Equipment</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A glass of red wine</li>
  <li>A sheet of wax paper</li>
  <li>A hole punch
    <h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Drink the glass of wine.  </strong> I mean, you really only need to stain your tongue with the wine, but there are sober children in China so be a hero and drink the glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Cut up the wax paper.  </strong> Take your hole punch and apply it to the wax paper.  If you need further instructions for this step, you need to go find an adult.</li>
      <li><strong>Lick the wax paper. </strong> Take  one of those little wax circles you‚Äôve made and place it on the front part of your tongue for a few seconds.</li>
      <li><strong>Count the bumps.</strong> Now look at that little circle and count the number</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tasting-myths">Tasting Myths</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hot or Spicy is a ‚ÄúTaste‚Äù
    <ul>
      <li>WRONG ‚Äî Technically this is just a pain signal sent but the nerves that transmits touch and temperature sensations.  So any time we season food with chili peppers or sriracha, we‚Äôre literally trying to torture the diner.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tongues have specific ‚ÄúZones‚Äù for tastes
    <ul>
      <li>WRONG ‚Äî The basic tastes of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory can actually be sensed by all parts of the tongue.</li>
      <li>The truth is that the tip and sides of the tongue are more sensitive than the middle of the tongue, and that‚Äôs true for all tastes EXCEPT for bitter.
        <ul>
          <li>The back of our tongue is VERY SENSITIVE to bitter tastes.  This is apparently to protect us so that we can spit out poisonous or spoiled foods before they enter the throat and are swallowed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The other truth is that each taste bud has a hierarchy for what it IS sensitive for, but they all sense all the components
        <ul>
          <li>The front of the tongue taste buds are more sensitive to sweetness</li>
          <li>Towards the back of the sides of the tongue is more sensitive to salt.</li>
          <li>Towards the middle of the sides of the tongue is more sensitive to sour.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-wine-nerds-taste-wine">How Wine-Nerds taste wine</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-look-at-the-wine">Step 1: Look at the Wine</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fill the glass about one-third full.
    <ul>
      <li>NEVER FILL MORE THAN HALF</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pick the glass up by the stem.
    <ul>
      <li>Holding the glass by its bowl hides some of the liquid from view, the heat of your hand warms the wine, and your fingerprints could blur the color.  So grab it by the stem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Focus on three visual aspects of the wine: Hue, Intensity, and Clarity
    <ul>
      <li>Hue ‚Äî This is the true color of the wine.
        <ul>
          <li>Hue is best judged by tilting the glass and looking at the wine through the rim.  This lets you see the variation from the deepest part of the liquid out to its edges.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Intensity
        <ul>
          <li>View this looking straight down on the wine from above.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Clarity ‚Äî Whether the wine is brilliant or cloudy with particles.
        <ul>
          <li>Most evident when the light is shining sideways through the glass.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Swirl and look again
    <ul>
      <li>Grip the stem of the glass between your thumb and forefinger, let the base sit on the table, and swirl the wine by rotating your wrist.  Swirl until the wine has climbed nearly to the rim and then stop.</li>
      <li>As the wine settles, a transparent film will appear on the inside of the glass falling slowly and irregularly down the sides in the wine‚Äôs ‚Äútears‚Äù or ‚Äúlegs‚Äù.
        <ul>
          <li>This is an indication of the alcohol level.  The more tears or legs, the more alcohol.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-2-smell-the-wine">Step 2: Smell the Wine</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Swirling the wine to view the legs is also your introduction into the next stage of wine tasting, smelling the wine.
    <ul>
      <li>When the wine is agitated, it vaporizes a little bit that releases a lot of aromas into the air inside the glass.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There‚Äôs no <em>right way</em> to smelling the wine, other than make sure you stick your nose deep inside that glass.
    <ul>
      <li>Some people say take one long deep breath.</li>
      <li>Some people suggest taking two or three quick little inhalations.</li>
      <li>Heck, some people even plug one nostril and sniff, then plug the other nostril and sniff.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The point is, you want to get as much of that vaporized liquid full of aromas into the back of your nasal passages so that your brain can best process as many of the aromas as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-3-taste-the-wine">Step 3: Taste the Wine</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Now the wine nerds are finally ready for the best part, tasting the wine.  But just like everything else, over the past few thousand years of drinking wine, we‚Äôve found ways to really taste as much of the wine as we can.</li>
  <li>First, take a sip.
    <ul>
      <li>Don‚Äôt drink too much or your body will force you to swallow what‚Äôs in your mouth.  Instead, try to sip in about a third to half an ounce.
        <ul>
          <li>You want enough wine to be able to coat every last bit of your mouth that could possibly tell you about the wine.
            <ul>
              <li>That‚Äôs all sides of your tongue, the soft palate in the roof of your mouth, the back of your throat, and even the insides of your cheek.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keep the wine in your mouth.
    <ul>
      <li>Again, you don‚Äôt want the wine to go straight from the glass into your stomach.  Yes, there are taste buds that this would interact with, but most people suggest holding the wine in your mouth from 10-15 seconds at least.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Roll the wine around in your mouth.
    <ul>
      <li>You want to taste everything you can in the wine so bring as much of your tasting organ into contact with the wine.
        <ul>
          <li>You can taste how astringent the tannins are through the inner sides of your cheeks.</li>
          <li>You can taste the bitterness and/or alcohol heat in the back of your throat.</li>
          <li>The sweetness on the front of your tongue.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aerate the wine a bit more.
    <ul>
      <li>Before you swallow, purse your lips a little bit and suck in some air over the wine sitting on your tongue.  You‚Äôll make a little bubbling sound that amuses small children and upsets classy dinner partners.
        <ul>
          <li>This brings even more aromas into the retronasal passage that connects your throat and nose.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Chew then swallow.
    <ul>
      <li>Yeah, that‚Äôs right, the last step before you swallow is to actually <i>chew</i> a liquid.
        <ul>
          <li>What this does is make sure that your mouth moves around a bit so the wine can get into every nook and crevice, making sure that every possible taste bud gets a shot at analyzing the wine.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Then swallow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-4-focus-on-the-finish">Step 4: Focus on the Finish</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You‚Äôve now swallowed the wine, <em>but you are not done!!!</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Now you want to analyze how the wine ‚Äúfinishes‚Äù, or how the wine plays with your senses after you‚Äôve swallowed.
        <ul>
          <li>The better the wine is, the more complex, profound, and long-lasting the residual flavors and aromas will be.</li>
          <li>With really great wines (and sensitive tasters), the flavors and aromas could last over a minute!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After you swallow, exhale gently and slowly.
    <ul>
      <li>Try to exhale through both your mouth and your nose.  This will really activate the retronasal passage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bonus-wine-nerd-order-of-tasting">Bonus: Wine Nerd Order of Tasting</h3>

<p>There are a few rules to follow when deciding which wines to drink in which order</p>
<h4 id="rule-1-young-before-old">Rule 1: Young before Old</h4>
<p>As wines get older they become more flavorful and complex, therefore it‚Äôs best to enjoy older wines after younger wines.  This will let you really savor those complex flavors without having to worry about the next wine to drink.</p>

<h4 id="rule-2-dry-before-sweet">Rule 2: Dry before Sweet</h4>
<p>Sweet wines tend to leave you feeling satiated whereas dry wines encourage more drinking. Likewise, the acidity that balances out a lot of sweet wines will interfere with the flavors of a dry wine.</p>

<h4 id="rule-3-white-before-reds">Rule 3: White before Reds</h4>
<p>Red wines always have just a bit thicker of a mouthfeel than almost all white wines meaning you really want to start with the light crisp white wines.</p>

<h4 id="rule-4-dessert-wines-last">Rule 4: Dessert Wines Last</h4>
<p>They are so heavily fortified and rich that they will overwhelm any wines you try to taste afterwards.</p>

<h4 id="wines-to-drink-in-order">Wines to Drink in Order</h4>
<p>Here‚Äôs an ordered list of the wines to drink in a tasting so that you can best experience your wines.</p>
<ol>

<h1 id="tasting-exercises">Tasting Exercises</h1>
<p>Here are some various tasting exercises that will help train you to better experience wine when you taste it.</p>
<h2 id="tasting-tannin">Tasting Tannin</h2>
<p>Remember that tannins are the compounds found in the grape‚Äôs skin, seeds, and stems that give that ‚Äúdrying‚Äù effect to your mouth.  Because of this, tannins pair especially well with dishes that have a lot of fat or meat.</p>

<h3 id="tannin-in-the-wild">Tannin in the Wild</h3>
<p>Tannin comes from two places when it comes to wine: the grapes and oak aging.</p>

<p><strong>Tannin from Grapes</strong> comes primarily from the skins and seeds of the grapes.  The longer they are in contact with the wine-juice, the more tannins they impart to the wine.  This kind of tannin will taste more ‚Äúgreen‚Äù in the wine and will really hit the sides and front of your mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Tannin from Oak</strong> comes from the wood itself as the wine sits in contact with it.  That means that the longer the wine sits in contact, the more tannins it will take in.  Also, the age of the wood used imparts different amounts of tannin into the wine.  New Oak that has never been used to contain fluid before will leech out more tannins than used oak.  Tannins from oak taste more smooth and round as they hit your palate and the center of your tongue.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Wine Tannin</strong> can be found in unsweetened black tea.  This is such a pure example of tannin that damn near every wine website on the internet uses this.  But other high-tannin foods include walnuts, almonds, dark chocolate, cinnamon, and clove.</p>

<h2 id="tasting-body">Tasting Body</h2>
<p>Body is the sense of weight, richness, heaviness, or even the feeling of thickness that a wine leaves in your mouth.  As a general rule, the more alcohol in a wine, the more body it will have.  That means that wines from warmer climates tend to be much more full-bodied than cool climate wines.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tasting-acidity">Tasting Acidity</h2>
<p>Now you‚Äôre talking about tasting that mouth-watering factor in wine, you know that pucker that makes you want to drink a bit more.  This is the driver behind what makes some white wines so refreshing in a hot afternoon.</p>

<p>Tasting acidity will tell you a lot about the climate that the grapes were grown in.  A cooler climate tends to grow grapes with a higher acidity (since they don‚Äôt ripen as fully) whereas warmer climates produce low acid wines that taste smooth and creamy.</p>

<h2 id="tasting-alcohol">Tasting Alcohol</h2>
<p>Okay, this one should be fairly self-explanatory but there are a couple of aspects to note. First, genetics has a lot to do with how each person tastes alcohol, some taste it as spicy, some taste it as ‚Äúhot‚Äù, and some people just love the bejeezus out of it.  Second thing to note is that alcohol adds body to a wine, so the higher ABV, the fuller-bodied the wine will feel in your mouth.</p>

<h2 id="tasting-oak">Tasting Oak</h2>
<p>Of course part of tasting oak is tasting tannins, especially in white wines, but this segment is all about the oaky part.</p>

<p>The longer the wine sits in the oak, the more the vanillan compound will leave the oak that it lived in for the wine that it loves, which is why many oaked wines have a vanilla taste.</p>

<p>Oak also tends to hide or smooth out a lot of the fruit flavors in wine.</p>

<h3 id="oak-in-the-wild">Oak in the Wild</h3>
<h4 id="american-vs-french-oak">American vs French Oak</h4>
<p>Just like we tend to be more brash and assertive than our Parisian cousins, American Oak versus French Oak share similar differences.
	- American oak imparts more coconut, vanilla, and sweet spice flavors when it interacts with wine.
		- French oak tends to impart more dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean, and savory spice flavors to the wine.
	- French oaked wine can come across as more elegant and complex due to the more subtle effect of the milder oak.
		- American oaked wine comes across as much more assertive and bold.</p>

<h4 id="new-oak-vs-old-oak">New Oak vs Old Oak</h4>
<p>Like a tea bag, the more times you use an oak barrel, the less flavor it imparts.<br />
	- The first time you use a barrel, it imparts the most flavor
	- The second time, it imparts a lot less flavor
	- The third time you use a barrel, it hardly imparts any flavor
	- Any time after that and the barrel is pretty much neutral and drained of off all its vanillan.</p>

<h2 id="tasting-aroma-and-flavors">Tasting Aroma and Flavors</h2>
<p>Now I listed this one last on the tasting page because it‚Äôs the one thing that every restaurant wine tasting class <em>does</em> cover.  We tend to think of wines as having certain ‚Äúflavors‚Äù so when we learn about them we learn about those flavors and sometimes how they interact with the different dishes.</p>

<p>But since wine tasting is so subjective, does that even matter?  Should we tell the guests what flavors to expect . . . what if they aren‚Äôt as trained as you are and all the taste is a ‚Äúred wine flavor‚Äù?  Have we damaged their experience by leaving them wanting?</p>

<p>That‚Äôs up to you.</p>

<h3 id="aroma-and-flavors-exercise-1-tech-sheet-tasting">Aroma and Flavors Exercise 1: Tech Sheet Tasting</h3>
<p>This is a fairly simple ‚Äúexercise‚Äù that really depends on which wines you‚Äôre drinking.  What you want to do is take the wine‚Äôs ‚ÄúTech Sheet‚Äù or whatever guidance the winemaker / vendor has given you about what to expect from the wine.  Look at that sheet and find the flavors and aromas and then choose a two groups of items from that list.</p>
<h4 id="supplies-needed-10">Supplies Needed</h4>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- 2 Groups of items that mirror the tasting notes
	- Example: Chardonnay
		- Lemon zest and pineapple juice in one group
		- slices of banana, apple, pear, peach, apricot, and fresh butter in the other group
	- Example: Cabernet Sauvignon
		- Blackberries, black cherries in one group
		- coffee, vanilla, spices, dark chocolate and bell pepper in the other group
- A blindfold
- A glass of the target wine
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="steps-10">Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Smell
    <ul>
      <li>Set up the two groups of items and the glass of wine in front of you</li>
      <li>Put your blindfold on and smell each group</li>
      <li>Swirl the wine and stick your nose in the glass and smell</li>
      <li>Then smell one group and smell the wine again</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Taste
    <ul>
      <li>Now take another deep whiff of one of the item groups</li>
      <li>Then swirl and taste the wine</li>
      <li>Repeat with the other group</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analyze
    <ul>
      <li>Were you able to notice the different flavors?</li>
      <li>Can you pinpoint individual flavors?</li>
      <li>Do any of the aromas or flavors remind you of any specific memories?</li>
      <li>Do either of the item group flavors show up more on the finish after you‚Äôve swallowed?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aroma-and-flavors-exercise-2-identify-this-smell-non-alc">Aroma and Flavors Exercise 2: Identify This Smell (non-alc)</h3>
<p>The best way to learn flavors and aromas is to get as much experience identifying different smells while blindfolded.  There are numerous kits for sale on the internet full of essential oils or scratch-and-sniff cards that will help you learn, but these can be expensive.  (The master sommelier wine aroma kit with 88 wine aromas is $450 on Amazon as of 9/30/22!)</p>

<p>This is a much cheaper way.</p>

<h4 id="steps-11">Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Prepare
    <ul>
      <li>First put your blindfold on</li>
      <li>Then have your partner lay out the items in a specific order
        <ul>
          <li>Or your partner can place them one at a time in front of you</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Smell
    <ul>
      <li>Once the item is set, your partner should let you know so you can smell it without touching the item. The only clues you want are the ones from your sense of smell since that accounts for the majority of our taste.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analyze
    <ul>
      <li>Describe what the smell reminds you of as you go down the list.</li>
      <li>Have your partner tell you if you got it right or wrong.</li>
      <li>Continue to describe it if you got it right.  Does the smell remind you of a specific memory? Can you tell a story about that memory (helps you lock in that smell).</li>
      <li>If you got it wrong, have your partner add it to the end of your row so that you can try again before you take off the blindfold.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
