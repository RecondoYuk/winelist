<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>
<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<p>Established in 2002, Cliff Lede Vineyards encompasses sixty acres in the famed Stags Leap District. Founder Cliff Lede, Director of Vineyard Operations Allison Wilson, and Director of Winemaking Christopher Tynan have come together to form an unrivaled team, making the most of this remarkable property.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vineyards are named after Rock &amp; Roll songs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="region">Region</h3>
<p><strong>Stags Leap District, California</strong>
<strong>Vineyards</strong>  → The fruit was sourced from the hillside terrace of our Poetry Vineyard, our Twin Peaks Vineyard estate surrounding the winery, and a few neighboring vineyards in the Stags Leap District. The wine is composed of small lots from our best blocks, representing a diverse range of carefully selected clones and rootstocks. From Poetry’s exposed, rocky terraces boasting volcanic origins, to the ancient riverbed alluvial soils of Twin Peaks, the breadth of contributing sites translates into a wine of impressive complexity.</p>

<h3 id="winemaking">Winemaking</h3>
<p><strong>Vintage</strong> → The 2019 vintage was a magnificent year for Napa Valley. A frost-free and uniform bud break was followed by a cool wet spring that included three inches of rain in May. Luckily, the rain didn’t affect set and the weather turned warm and sunny for the duration of spring. Welcome warm nights in June, July, and August caught maturation back on schedule. Summer conditions were moderate, with warm days and cool nights, ideal for slow and steady grape maturation. The wine shows exceptional balance with concentrated, ripe fruit complemented by bright acidity and supple, yet intense, structure. Optimal ripeness was achieved thanks to an early autumn of consistently warm, but not hot, days. The pristine ripening conditions allowed for very intense fruit flavor concentrations.</p>

<p><strong>Winemaking</strong> → Grapes were picked in the darkness of the early morning hours. The freshly harvested fruit immediately underwent rigorous selection by our three-tiered sorting process, which included our cutting-edge optical sorter. Whole berries were gently delivered by gravity to tank using our crane system, minimizing disruption of berry integrity. Cold soaks lasted approximately seven days, and fermentations were managed via a combination of <em>délestage</em>, pumpovers, and punchdowns. Extended maceration ranging from four to five weeks fine-tuned our tannin profiles, allowing us to perfect mouth feel and wine complexity.</p>

<h3 id="tasting-notes">Tasting Notes</h3>
<p>“The essence of our proud Stags Leap District terroir in a glass, the 2019 vintage produced a delicious wine of purity, warmth, and grace. Built on a foundation of lush cassis, blackberry, and dark cherry aromas, this long and full-bodied wine is apportioned with a perfume of cardamom, clove, and ancho Chile. Graphite, chocolate cake, crushed mulberries, and grilled steak notes make an appearance along the way and add to a long and complex finish” — <em>Christopher Tynan, Director of Winemaking</em></p>
