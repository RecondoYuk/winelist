## Provenance
### Winery
 - Introduced in 2015, the Substance brand was conceived with a single-minded vision: to produce the best value-priced Cabernet Sauvignon in America. Substance “Cs” Cabernet Sauvignon is made with traditional winemaking techniques: natural fermentations, barrel-aging, and bottled unfiltered and unfixed. In essence, Charles makes Substance ‘Cs’ with small batch winemaking integrity on an unprecedented scale.
 - With the success of Substance ‘Cs’ Cabernet Sauvignon, the brand expanded to include Substance Vineyard Collection

### Winemaking 
The 2019 vintage was on the cooler side as it started slow with later-than-usual bud break and continued on to be fairly moderate throughout the year. Some vineyards had issues with an October freeze a bit earlier than usual, but our high-elevation vineyards have great air drainage which allows us to extend the growing season late into October without freeze. This yielded fantastic ripening and some awesome wines with incredible balance and character. Overall, we are excited about the wine produced in 2019, which has brought us more finesse, incredible flavors and lovely balance.

### Tasting Notes
* “Currants, flowers, and walnuts on the nose. Medium-bodied with a pretty core of fruit and fine tannins and a crisp finish. Lead pencil. Fresh. Compact. Delicate and delicious. Enjoy. Drink or hold.” — *James Suckling*
* “Juicy blue fruits, leafy tobacco, violets, and orange blossom notes all emerge from the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Cs and it’s medium to full-bodied, has a beautifully balanced, fruit-forward style, no hard edges, and a great finish. It’s no simple fruit bomb and has notable structure, ripe tannins, and outstanding length. It reminds me of a top Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux and represents a stunning value. Drink it over the coming 7-8 years” — *Jeb Dunnuck*
