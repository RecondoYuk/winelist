# Dukes’s Wine List
## Intro
	On July 25th, 2022 Dukes Beachhouse Maui will be rolling out a new wine list as well as updating some cocktails and adding a larger beer pour option.  Now I have always been impressed with how well TS Restaurants seems to have their shit together, especially when it comes to informing their teams, but in the past they have treated changes to the wine lists like every other restaurant does: they print out the “Tech Sheet” or “Sell Sheet” that the winery/vendor has on the wine and then put them together in a printed packet to hand out to the servers.  Over the past two decades, I have seen it done this way in every restaurant I have been affiliated with.  It’s the way it is done, and the service industry doesn’t change easily.
	This time TS went above and beyond and actually compiled an informative packet that really does a great job, as well as an additional single sheet.  The main packet isn’t just printed sell-sheets, what they did was pull just a blurb or two from the sell sheets or vendors info and then plopped that on some graphics taken from WineFolly.com.  Interspersed between the sheets are one-page descriptions of the different main wine styles. That managed to take out a lot of the bulk information that isn’t useful for servers at our level and simplified it so it should get read more.  The single sheet takes all of the new bottle wines and lists their blurb and flavors without the graphics.  Really impressed.
	But, we still lean on the printed forms which a lot of employees just fold up and lose without ever really reading them.  At this point in the game we should be leaning on technology and using the web more.  We can fit more information in a much more digestible form, and one that can (and will) be viewed while on the shitter.  That’s why I am attempting here.
## How to Use this Site 
	The goal of this site is to provide a resource for anyone at Dukes Beachhouse to use to learn the wine list better so we can provide frictionless service to our guests.  We have a couple of Sommelier’s on staff, a bunch of career servers with 10+ years in the industry, as well as brand new servers who have never opened a wine bottle, much less sold them to guests.  That wide range of knowledge base is tough for managers to train as a group, especially while they deal with Pandemic-problems like staffing and safety-standards.
	In order to cover all those bases, I have designed this site to work in a couple of different ways.  
### For those who know nothing (but want to know everything):
	Start with the history of wine.  That’s the starting point that will link at the bottom of the next page with the next on the list.  You’ll go through what wine is and how it’s been spread throughout our history, then you’ll move on to the technical aspects of wine itself including what impacts the flavors, before we even begin talking about the different wines and how to taste, drink, and describe them.
	After that you can get into the Dukes’ specific lists and wine descriptions since you’ll be able to know then what to look for.   
### For those who know wine a little bit and want all the info:
	Start with the Winelist Walk-Thru where you will go through the entire new wine list broken down by wine type where you’ll learn detailed information about each wine, where it comes from, what makes it unique, and how to sell it to every guest.  
	Then get into how flavors work when selling and pairing wine, especially ours. Here we will go over the flavors in food, how different people taste different things in wine, and how to use the wine list to really help the guests experience their food better.
	After that you can get into the tips and tricks on how to beat the guests’s expectations every time so that we can create lasting memories (and make lots and lots of money).  
	At this point you know as much as I do, but if you want to continue on to the review sections, you can!
### For those who just want some easy info:
	Flip around and look at whatever you want! I would suggest you glance at how the flavors work first, glance through the tips and tricks, and then choose the list from below that works best for you!
### For those who know more than me:
	There’s probably a lot of you! I would head to the page of lists, the reviews.  Here I have broken down the wines by multiple different methods
 - **By the List** $\rightarrow$ Organized just like Dukes has it, by the glass first and then bottled wine in order of wine style
	 - One list will just have one or two words to describe each wine
	 - One list will have the scores of the wines
 - **By style** $\rightarrow$ Organized by wine style, glasses and bottles mixed. 
	 - One list will have the one or two word descriptions
	 - One list will have the Dukes Flavors and Blurb
 - **By Taste** $\rightarrow$ Organized by the different profiles of the wine styles
	 - One list will be by Body
	 - One list will be by Flavor
	 - One list will be by Acidity / Tannins
	 - One list will be by  big 5 flavors
 - **By Geography** $\rightarrow$ Organized by where the grapes are grown 
	 - One list is Old World vs New World
	 - One list is Warm Climate vs Cooler Climate
	 - One list by Soil maybe?
 - **By the Menu** $\rightarrow$ Organized by the food menu, here you will find quick lists to help you match the food with wine.
	 - One list is classical pairings (suggested by the winemakers)
	 - One list of congruent pairings
	 - One list of complementary pairings
