## Provenance
### Winery
Our winemaking team works with a family of growers to source a diverse variety of grapes from premier vineyards throughout California. The resulting wines are interesting blends of distinct quality and character.
 - Inspired by the “Mixed Blacks”
   - The Prisoner was inspired by the blended wines first made by the Italian immigrants who originally settled in Napa Valley. The Prisoner is now the most recognized red blend, leading the resurgence of interesting blends by incorporating Zinfandel with the unlikely mix of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Syrah, and Merlot
 - The Label
   - Inspired by an etching titled *Le Petit Prisonnier* by 19th century Spanish artist Francisco Goya.
     - The subtitle translates to “*the custody is as barbaric as the crime*”. 
     - Part of Goya’s series “The Disasters of War”
       - Created as a visual protest to the injustice and brutality of the Spanish War of Independence in 1808.
   - Prisoner Wine Company has stood against oppression while embracing creativity.
     - Fights injustices tied to the prison and policing systems is a focus of their commitment as an organization
