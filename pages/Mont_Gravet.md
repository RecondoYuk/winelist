## Provenance
### Winery 
- Masterwines was started by Mel and Janie Master in France in 1990 when its main business was sourcing great value wines from the Languedoc region of the south oof France.
* Mel and Janie are from England but are both now US Citizens. Mel has been in the wine business ever since leaving school and he met Janie when they were only twelve and thirteen (she played the piano and he played the guitar!) and as they grew up together, they shared a passion for food and wine. They married at 19 and 20.
The couple left England to live in France in 1970 and started a company called Master Wines and began selling little known French wines in the USA. Mel was a pioneer in bringing great wine values to the USA from France.
- Mont Gravet
	- Close to the producers, and in order to source from the best vineyards, our winemaker has found some amazing “*terroirs*” in South of France. The Languedoc climatic conditions allow a perfect maturation for the grapes which are moderated by the humid influence of the Mediterranean.
	* “Mont” is what the hills are called in French, and “Gravet” is a the name of an oval shaped rock commonly found in the area.
	* Mont Gravet comes from vineyards located in the Gascony region, near the city of Toulouse in the South West of France. The climate combines the Oceanic and Mediterranean influences, which brings enough sun and humidity to grow rich, concentrated and ripe grapes. Close to the producers, and in order to source the best vineyards, our winemaker has found some amazing “terroirs” spread on hills. These hills are called “Mont” in French. So as a tribute to the terroir from where the wine comes from we have named in Mont Gravet, “Gravet” being the name of an oval shaped rock commonly found in the area.
### Region
**South France (IGP Pays d’Oc)**
- Specifically the Cinsault vineyards in the Languedoc region, located near the warm Mediterranean shoreline in Southern France.
* The Cinsault variety is also one of the main varietals used in the production of Provence of Rosé and some of the best reds of the Southern Rhone Valley

### Winemaking 
2018 Vintage was eaerly, with low volume but the result offers an outstanding quality. The budburst happened very early as the winter has been rainy and warm, enhancing the vintage earliness. During spring, the lowrain level and the frost have led to lower yields. However, the resulting juices were concentrated with light colors but full aromas.

## Wine
### Grapes
100% Cinsault

The grapes are harvested at night when the temperature is cool, in order to prevent from oxidation and to preserve the subtle fruity aromas. The juice goes through a gentle pressing then the fermentation process at low temperature to enhance the elegant aromatic profile. The wine stays on its fine lees at least two months and is stirred periodically providing a smooth texture.
