## Provenance
### Winery
K Vintners is Charles Smith’s Rhone-focused label and the one that has garnered him the highest scores (including multiple 100-pts). In fact, this Syrah just received 98 points! From Charles: “Considering I only made single vineyard Syrah, like I still do, I didn’t know what to write on the barrel,” he laughed. “Well, resting on one of the barrels was my cat, a tabby. She had an “M” on her forehead, so I’d named her Motor City Kitty ‘cause she was such a rock & roll cat. I wrote her name on that barrel so I wouldn’t forget which one it was, and thus the wine was named for my very Detroit tabby cat, MCK.”

### Region
**Yakima Valley, Washington**

MCK (Motor City Kitty) is sustainably grown on legendary Washington vineyard operator Dick Boushey’s Oldfield Block, which was planted with help from our own winemaker, Brennon Leighton. Coming from high elevation and sandy, volcanic soils, MCK is still crafted from three distinct Syrah clones to make one of our longest running wines.

### Winemaking 
 - **Vintage Notes**
	- The 2019 vintage was on the cooler side as it started slow with later-than-usual bud break and continued on to be fairly moderate throughout the year. Some vineyards had issues with an October freeze a bit earlier than usual, but our high-elevation vineyards have great air drainage which allows us to extend the growing season late into October without freeze. This yielded fantastic ripening and some awesome wines with incredible balance and character. Overall, we are excited about the wine produced in 2019, which has brought us more finesse, incredible flavors and lovely balance.

### Tasting Notes
Plum, Black Cherry, White Pepper, Cured Meat
“Layered aromas of plums, black cherries, leather, bark and iron. Full-bodied with a lot of nuance. Firm, gripping tannins. Dried roses and crushed blackberries mix with dark, mineral complexity, leaving a buzz on the palate. A clear note of cocoa powder comes through. Concentrated and dynamic.” — James Suckling
