### Tasting Notes
Showcasing the rich diversity of the Anderson Valley, this exuberant wine displays fresh, enticing aromas of juicy raspberry, simmer strawberry, and red plum, as well as hints of bramble, black tea, anise, sweet saddle leather, and a touch of salinity. On the palate, bright acidity and firm, chewy tannins converge to create a supple texture that accentuates the Bing cherry and blackberry pie flavors, with sophisticated notes of nutmeg, cardamom, and savory umami emerging on the finish to create a sumptuous and cerebral drinking experience.
