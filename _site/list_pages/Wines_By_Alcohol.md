### Wines By Alcohol (Bitter/Sweet) Low-to-High
How we interpret alcohol (bitter, sweet, spicy, and/or oily) is based on our genetics.   (Half population it tastes neutral, 1/4 taste it as bitter and 1/4 taste it as sweet)
Wines with a high alcohol level tend to have a fuller body, while lower ABV leads to lighter-bodied wines.
Higher alcohol wines are also sweeter with bolder ripe fruit flavors.  Alcohol adds viscosity to the wine and balances out the sweetness and acidity.
