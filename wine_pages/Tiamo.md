## Provenance
### Winery 
Our Tiamo Pinot Grigio comes from a single organically farmed vineyard in San Dona di Piave located between Venice and Treviso. The region is ideally suited for the Pinot Grigio grape with soils that are high in clay and sand and vines located on hillsides with good exposure to the sun.
 - In order to have organically grown grapes, a vineyard manager must implement an entirely different set of practices to maintain their vines. The vineyards have to be first certified in Italy but then must also receive the USDA certification of “Made with Organic Grapes”. No pesticides or fertilizers are permitted.

### Region
**Venezia D.O.C.**

Sourced from vineyards near Treason in the Veneto region

### Winemaking 
The grapes are picked at night when it is coolest.

### Tasting Notes
This is a great example of beautifully balanced Pinot Grigio. The wine is fresh, crisp, and dry but has a trememndous amount of flavor and body. There are suggestions of apple and pear on both the bouquet and the palate.
