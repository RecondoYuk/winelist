  <li>The name is inspired by the majestic views of Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier which serve as the backdrop of Copeland Vineyard. Itâ€™s a simple moniker that reflects our minimalistic approach to growing and making wine with a proud not to the incredible valley in which we farm.</li>
  <li>Thereâ€™s something uniquely fulfilling in working the same ground as our uncle, grandfather, and great-grandfather. It would be easy to take this humble life for granted, but we consider our role as growers to be more than just wine-grape production. We have an obligation to operate in a way that ensures the next generation inherits a world worthy of their potential. Becoming Washington Stateâ€™s first certified sustainable vineyard not only validates our efforts as growers, but reminds us of how fortunate we are to be surrounded and supported by an incredible team that is committed to making the right decisions for our land, our planet, and our customers.</li>
  <li>We like to joke that four generations of Yakima Valley farming pulsing through our veins predisposed us to dirty fingernails and an inherent love of the land, but it really is the truth. We love this life, and weâ€™re lucky to have it. We hope that shines through in our wines and that you enjoy them as we prefer - with friends and family.</li>
