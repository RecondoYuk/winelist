  <li>This yearâ€™s Fume Blanc is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc grapes from various appellations in Sonoma County â€” Dry Creek, Alexander, Russian River, and Knights Valleys â€” along with grapes from carefully selected vineyards in Mendocino and Lake counties.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="winemaking">Winemaking</h3>
<p>One of the first two wines Ferrari-Carano ever made over 35 years ago, this Fume Blanc is comprised of Sauvignon Blanc grapes from Sonoma (73%), Mendocino (18%) and Lake (9%) counties.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the grapes arrive at the winery, each lot is gently crushed and pressed into stainless steel tanks for 48 hours of cold settling. The juice is either transferred to stainless steel tanks or older French Oak barrels for fermentation. The wine in barrels is <em>sur lie</em> aged and stirred every other week for two months, then blended and bottled.</li>
