<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>
<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<p>Driven by one family’s passion for great winemaking, Mohua Wines was founded in 2009 to create exceptional wines from some of New Zealand’s highest quality regions. Our focus is on merging that vision with sustainable practices to craft wines that capture the essence of their environment, while improving the land that creates them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Mohua</strong> → A small colorful bird that can only be found in the pristine and majestic forests of New Zealand’s South Island. Once abundant, they are now classified as an endangered species, surviving in only remote areas. Mohua Wines is committed to helping ensure these stunning choristers flourish and regain their rightful place among New Zealand’s unique fauna.</li>
  <li><strong>Story/History</strong>→ Mohua Winery is a 2nd generation family owned and operated winery in New Zealand. Named after an endangered bird native to NZ and found only in the most remote parts of the South Island’s rain forests, the Mohua currently occupies less than 5% of its original territory. In partnership with the <strong>Department of Conservation (DOC)</strong>, Mohua provides financial support for protection initiatives, as well as assisting personally with relocation and sanctuary programs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="region">Region</h3>
<p><strong>Marlborough, New Zealand</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Marlborough has rapidly developed an international reputation for producing premium Sauvignon Blanc. The region is situated in the north-eastern corner of New Zealand’s South Island. Bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the East and towering mountain ranges in the hinterlands to the  North and south, a broad alluvial plain stretches from the coastline, gradually rising into narrow valleys with favorable northerly aspects.</li>
  <li>In the heart of Marlborough, we source our fruit from three sub-regions select for the distinct characters each location brings to the wine. Careful yield control then guarantees exceptional fruit from one of the world’s finest Sauvignon Blanc regions
    <ul>
      <li>The Lower Wairau</li>
      <li>Southern Valleys</li>
      <li>Central Wairau</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Land → The glacial carved Wairau Valley is typified by river silts over free draining gravels with lighter, stonier free draining soils in the upper valley relenting to deep rich silt top soils over river gravel in the lower valley on the East coast. The Southern Valleys which feed into the Wairau from the South generally exhibit higher levels of clay than the main Wairau Valley.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="winemaking">Winemaking</h3>
<p><strong>The Season</strong>→ 2021 provided its share of challenges, though was a warmer than average season overall. Initially impacted by early Spring frosts and followed by a cool flowering period which were the key causes for the small volumes harvested across the region. Low disease pressure and an early harvest were the result of drought like conditions from December to March, providing only 31% of the average rainfall during this period. The warm and dry weather pattern throughout much of the growing season allowed the fruit to develop intensity and wonderful balance which has translated beautifully into the finished wine.</p>
