    <p>A to Z Wineworks was started in 2002 by Oregon wine industry veterans: Deb Hatcher (Eyrie), Bill Hatcher (Domain Drouhin Oregon), Sam Tannahill (Archery Summit) and Charyl Francis (Chehalem). The two couples worked in the Hatcher’s kitchen to build the original blend honored by Food &amp; Wine Magazine as the Best American Pinot Noir under $20. Recognition for A to Z wines as offering dependable quality for great value continues today making A to Z the top-selling Oregon wine brand.</p>

    <p>The 2019 A to Z Pinot Noir is a blend of fruit from across Oregon and approximately 80 different fermentations. Once primary and secondary fermentation are complete, many trials result in a single cuvée blended to highlight classic Oregon Pinot Noir qualities.
<strong>Vintage Notes</strong> → A challenging 2019 vintage began warm and wet into early June. All regions of Western Oregon experienced increased disease pressure from the high soil moisture and associated vegetative growth although our dry-farmed vineyards were happy. Proper canopy management and sound crop protection practices were crucial for success before summer arrived with average heat accumulation. Overcast conditions led to the coolest September and October since 2007, helping the fruit maintain acidity and freshness going into harvest. Interspersed showers during the harvest period slowed fruit development, and ripeness was achieved at lower sugars. It was a season definitely favoring wineries of fruit quickly in the short picking windows. Vintage 2019 was a true cool climate year, and a reminder that good work and proper timing can achieve great things in Oregon wine.</p>

    <h3 id="tasting-notes">Tasting Notes</h3>
    <p>A beautiful deep, garnet red color in the glass, the 2019 A to Z Wineworks Oregon Pinot Noir presents dark cherry and red berry aromatics with hints of pomegranate, rhubarb, baking spices, cola, and cedar. These are lifted by warm secondary notes of vanilla, leather, sandalwood, a hint of toast and a subtle, deeper, earthy layer of forest floor and mushrooms. Succulent flavors follow on the palate: juicy, ripe, red fruit and black plum, brambly blue fruits, fig compote, cocoa, and a dash of pip tobacco and graphite. The 2019 A to Z Oregon Pinot Noir is a ridiculously food-friendly, true Oregon Wine with fruit, earth, and spice notes. The smooth texture, mouth-watering acidity, and well-integrated tannins leave a silky finish.</p>
