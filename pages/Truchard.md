## Provenance
### Winery
- History
	- in 1887, Jean Marie Truchard emigrated from Lyôn France with his brother Father Anthony Marie Truchard. 
		- Established a vineyard and winery on a 500-acre plot in Southeast Texas.
		- Prohibition caused them to turn that property into land for cattle grazing.
	- Jean Marie’s grandson Tony inherited his love of farming as well as his pioneering spirit. 
		- Went to undergrad at University of Texas at Austin, and then medical school at University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.
		- Then enrolled as an officer in the Army
	- 1972
		- Stationed at the Presidio in San Francisco, Tony bought 20 acres of an abandoned prune orchard in Carneros.
			- Hired a soil conservationist and they used the soil to trap the rainwater in reservoirs and then became the first Americans to use drip-irrigation like they were using in Israel instead of overhead sprinkling as was the current common practice.
		- Expanded over the years by converting pastures into vineyards (opposite of his grandfather’s process)
	- 1989
		- Began processing their own grapes and added an 11,000 square-foot cave to their premises.
	- The Truchard family has been farming vineyards for over 45 years and plans to carry on their legacy for many generations to come. The health of their soils, the quality of their water, and the overall health of the environment are all essential to their long-term plan of growing a multigenerational family farm.  
		- They will continue to farm sustainably and use fish friendly practices for years to come.
### Region
**Carneros, California**
**Vineyard**  → Seven separate clonal selections of Pinot Noir grow on the Truchard Estate Vineyard. Two “Martini” clones, the “Pommard” clone, the “Swan” clone and several new selections from France — Dijon 114, 115, 667, 777. Each selection provides a unique element of aromatic fruit, spice, and texture to the blend. The vines range from 23-45 years in age. They are planted in several select sites that take full advantage of the thin soils, rolling hills, and cooler temperatures, factors which combine to make the Carneros region ideal for producing Pinot Noir.
	* 100% Estate grown
	* Cooler than the rest of Napa

### Winemaking 
- 2019 is very similar to the near-perfect 2018 vintage. A cold winter with average rainfall made for a late bud-break. Ideal spring weather allowed for nice berry set and above average yields. Mild conditions throughout summer and fall allowed the fruit to slowly ripen and develop maximum flavor. The wines of 2019 are bold and intenser with nice structure.
- Harvested from Sept 7-27, 24.4˚Brix
* **Winemaking**  → All of the fruit was gently destemmed and crushed into open top fermenters with approximately 20% whole berries. Each lot was inoculated with Assmannhausen yeast, after “cold soaking” for up to 5 days. Fermentations were punched down three times daily with the temperature peaking at 92˚F. After 7 - 12 days of maceration, the lots were pressed, settled in tanks for 24 hours, and then put into barrel. This wine was aged for 10 months in French oak (35% new), and bottled in August of 2020. It is ready for immediate drinking, but will gracefully age for the next 12-15 years.
