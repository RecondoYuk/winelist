<p><strong>Localization</strong> → This vineyard, which is planted next to the Pinot Noir parcel is trained exactly the same way. The soil, which is mainly composed of <em>marl</em> in this area, is perfectly suitable for Chardonnay. The pruning used here is Guyot simple. It is located at an altitude reaching 360m to 380m, on so-called “Pernand marls”. This geological stratum, that is also present in Pernand-Vergelesses and the hill of Corton, explains the similarity with wines from these vineyard areas, the altitude bringing in a little more freshness.</p>

  <li><strong>Vintage 2018</strong> → 2018 is an early-harvest vintage marked by a spring and summer that were very hot and dry, resulting in very complete ripeness and perfectly healthy grapes.</li>
  <li>After a relatively mild and rainy winter 2017-2018, the cool, damp start of spring forecast a rather late harvest. The return of hot weather in April changed all that and the vines then set off growing very rapidly through to the end of summer. At the domain, the whole team had to double their efforts to keep up with the very active vine growth. Vine-flowering passed off perfectly from end May, announcing a harvest at the very beginning of September. The rainfall shortage in spring and summer did not pose a major problem for our vines, probably thanks to water reserves accumulated during the winter. Rain storms in the month of July allowed the vines to reach perfect ripemess at the beginning of September. Unfortunately, the storms on 3rd and 15th July provoked outbreaks of hail that seriously impacted on our sector the Hautes-Cotes de Nuits (average loss of crop at 50%) and our parcel of ‘Les Chaliots’ located in Nuits-Saint-Georges (loss of around 30%)</li>
  <li>We began harvesting on 4th September on the ‘Cote’ and finished on 17th September in the Hautes-Cotes. Grape healthiness was absolutely perfect and sorting was virtually unnecessary. Only the crop from hail-damaged parcels had to be very carefully sorted and we were lucky to be able to use an optical grape sorter to removre grapes damaged by hail.</li>
  <li>This relatively early date of harvest and the perfect grape healthiness led to production of wines of great purity with beautiful freshness and bursting with fruit. The vintage already promises to be a very good one for laying down.</li>
  <li><strong>Vinification</strong> → The grapes are de-stemmed, crushed and put into a tank for a night to undergo a skin-maceration, it is then pressed on the following day. Overnight settling of the juice. Yeasting of the must and beginning of the alcoholic fermentation in temperature controlled tank (max 22 degrees Celsius). Transferring into casks when fermentation is partly complete (2/3 of the necessary time).</li>

  <li><strong>Acidity</strong>:</li>
  <li><strong>ABV</strong>: 13.0%</li>
  <li><strong>Aging</strong>: The wines complete their fermentation slowly in barrels at cellar temperature. The proportion of new oak amounts to about 20%. A stirring of the lees is done at the same time as the topping up of the barrels (every 10 days on average), until the end of the malolactic fermentation. Barrel conservation ends in the middle of the summer. The wine is then blended in vats and filtered on Kieselgur on the day before bottling.</li>
