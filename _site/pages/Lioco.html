<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>
<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<p>LIOCO was conceived in the alley behind Spago Beverly Hills by wine director Kevin O’Connor and wine salesman Matt Licklider. The two colleagues, critical of the heavy-handed wines of the day, wondered if it were possible to make some local wines that favored nuance over sheer power. In 2005, relying on nothing more than their palates and their rolodexes, the two embarked on a winemaking odyssey. Europe was the inspiration, as were the more restrained California wines of the 1980’s.
Today the winery is owned and operated by the Licklider family. Husband/wife duo Matt and Sara Licklider and their small team produce the wines at a state-of-the-art winemaking cooperative in Santa Rosa. All of the fruit is purchased from exceptional vineyards spanning 200-miles and three counties (Santa Cruz, Sonoma, and Mendocino).</p>

<p><em>Trust in the raw material and get out of the way</em></p>

<p>If the fruit is well-grown and comes from a compelling site, there is no way to improve upon it. Our job is simply to usher it through the process of fermentation and into bottle with as little intervention as possible. This has been our approach since Day 1 despite real incentives to conform to a more commercial style.</p>

<p><strong>Sonoma County, California</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Site</strong> A selection of complementary Sonoma County vineyards compose this wine. While each site is distinct, they share a common commitment to sustainable horticulture and strident farming. Our intention for this wine is to express the unique character of this region. Warm days and cool nights, tempered by consistent oceanic fog, yield nuanced Chardonnays balanced by brisk acidity.</li>
  <li><strong>Vineyards</strong> Piner, Burnside, Occidental</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="winemaking">Winemaking</h3>
<p><strong>Vinification</strong> The fruit was hand-harvested, sorted, and the berries broken before being pressed. The majority was fermented in stainless steel tanks. A small portion went to neutral French oak for 6-months before assemblage. Malo completed. Cross-flow filtered prior to bottling.</p>

<h3 id="points-of-distinction">Points of Distinction</h3>
<p><strong>Notes</strong> The challenges in the 2020 vintage were formidable but not impossible. Pandemic aside, it was the widespread fires that necessitated loose knees. Several of our vineyard were exposed to periods of hazy air from fires in neighboring counties. The distance from these fires ultimately proved to be the saving grace. The lab kept sending us back clean samples, and theories emerged about vineyards being relatively safe provided the fires originated far away. To be extra cautious, we triaged every load of fruit and employed winemaking protocols honed in the 2008 fire vintage, so… early harvest dates, light pressings, multiple rackings to get juice off skins, and gentle extractions on the reds. You’ve already seen our 2020 Rosé of Carignan + 2020 Mendocino Pinot Noir, which should tell you what you need to know about LIOCO’s 2020 cuvées. The story we should be telling is about dramatic drought-concentration of the 2020 wines. Tiny crop, hot and dry year, minituraized cluster sizes, and winemaking protocols that produced very low juice yields, but remarkably dense wines.</p>
