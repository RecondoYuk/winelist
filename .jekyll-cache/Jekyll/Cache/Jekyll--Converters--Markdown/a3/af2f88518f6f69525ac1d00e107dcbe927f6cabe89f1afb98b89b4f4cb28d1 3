<p><strong>Story/History</strong>â†’ Chris Hall (vintner) and his family have been farming in Napa Valley since 1989. In addition to growing organic grapes, the Hall Family raises a herd of grass-fed highland beef cattle, produces estate-grown extra virgin olive oil and farm acres upon acres of organic fruits and vegetables throughout Northern California. Hunt &amp; Harvest is a stable of well-made, American table wines. Their direct access to quality vineyards coupled with our relationships with established grape growers, gives them the unique ability to produce wines from a diverse portfolio of varietals and regions.</p>

<p>2019 was a very wet winter with rain coming into spring. Keeping the vines in balance was especially important this year. Successful management of the vines along with wonderfully mild weather through summer gave us warm days and cool nights. This is a recipe for success in vineyards, the vintage gave us a great balance of sugar and acid with complete phenolic ripening We had ripe flavors with freshness along with nice acid balance.</p>
