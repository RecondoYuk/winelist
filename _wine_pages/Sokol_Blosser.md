## Provenance
### Winery
Our story began in 1971 when our parents, Susan Sokol and Bill Blosser, first planted vines in Oregon’s Dundee Hills. As second generation winegrowers, we are passionately committed to our family’s legacy of creating world-class wines, through sustainable methods, which express our distinctive hillside vineyards.

### Region
**Willamette Valley, AVA**

When Susan Sokol and Bill Blosser planted their first vines in the Dundee Hills AVA (American Viticultural Area) of the Willamette Valley in 1971, there was no wine industry in Oregon. Today, with over 900 wineries and more than 37,000 acres of planted vineyards, Oregon has grown exponentially and its wines are available throught the world. Sokol Blosser has survived, grown, and prospered as a family-owned and run operation, and their certified organic 89-acre property is now inspiring their 3rd generation.

### Winemaking 
We produce a dry style Pinot Gris which accentuates the minerality this varietal clearly expresses. In addition to fermentation size and temperature, the diversity of yeasts used to perform fermentation and the extended period of lees contact prior to blending and bottling contributes greatly to the complexity of this wine.
 - Grapes were carefully hand harvested at different points in ripeness, 21-24 degrees Brix, to capture variety of flavor profiles making this a more layered wine. When necessary, the clusters were sorted by hand to remove any flawed bunches. Our Pinot Gris is gently whole cluster pressed to minimize the extraction of bitterness from the skins.
 - The juice was chilled and allowed to settle for 2 days, then moved off the heavy sediment and transferred to stainless steel fermentation tanks. The Pinot Gris is aged in stainless steel vessels to retain and emphasize delicate floral and fruit aromatics. Additionally, we want to maintain bright acidity in our style of pinot gris so we do not push this wine thru malolactic (or secondary) fermentation. The wine remained in contact with its fine lees and stirred multiple times during the aging process to broaden the palate and develop weight without high alcohol or sugar. This 2018 blend is made entirely from Sokol Blosser estate grown fruit.

### Tasting Notes
Our 2018 Willamette Valley is bright, refreshing, and full of interesting flavors. Strong aromas of elder flower, ripe pears, honeysuckle, and slight hint of Armenian cucumber combine to create a captivating bouquet. On the palate you will experience flavors of ripe melon, lime zest, and lemon pith. This delightful wine finishes crisp with hints of green apple and fresh honeydew melon.

### Points of Distinction
The spring of 2018 wqas warmer than the average over the previous 10 years, and fairly dry. Bud break happened in mid-April and Bloom in early June, which can be a treacherous undertaking as the spring weather can mess up a healthy flowering. A giant hail storm descended on the Dundee Hills in early June, but luckily none of our Sokol Blosser Estate crop was ruined. The summer started like one giant furnace; July was a hot month and we had a lot of above 90 degree days. 

Just when it seemed like the hot weather would not stop, August came and more moderate weather with it. This helped slow the ripening down and even cooler weather in September allowed us to let the grapes hang longer, resulting in riper fruit without additional sugar accumulation. The 2018 vintage is our coolest growing season since 2012 and we believe it will be our best vintage since then as well.
