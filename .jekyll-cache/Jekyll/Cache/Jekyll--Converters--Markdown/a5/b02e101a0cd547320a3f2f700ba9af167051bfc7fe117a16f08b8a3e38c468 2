<h3 id="winemaking">Winemaking</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong> While the main “Love You Bunches” wine continues to be a 100% carbonic fermentation of Sangiovese, in 2019 we began making “Love You Bunches” rosé, where most of the fruit is pressed immediately for an extremely light-colored rosé. Some grapes rest 12-24 hours whole, to pick up some color and texture from the skins and pulp.</p>

<p><strong>Vinification</strong> Predominately immediate, direct press to ferment in tank (with some lost) held 12-24 hours for fermentation to kick off “carbonic” or whole-grape fermentation prior to pressing.</p>

<p><strong>Fermentation &amp; Elevage</strong> Stainless Steel tanks for a cool, extended fermentation. Aged 3 months in stainless steel.</p>

<p>If served chilled and tasted with an open mind, I believe this wine is irresistible. If you dare to disagree, taste this new 2019 vintage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ka Boom - cherry sour candy and a crunchy red verve that sings through the mouth, this redefines the STOLPMAN SO FRESH brand. A friendly carbonic upfront pop followed by a touch of tart berry eschewing in a dusting of zippy tannin. A touch darker and more giving than the tightly wound 2018.</li>

<h3 id="points-of-distinction">Points of Distinction</h3>
<p><strong>Vintage</strong> A cold spring led to a moderate summer without significant heat spikes through harvest. We jumped on the warmer San Luis Obispo County picks early to catch the fruit fresh and lively. This gave us the luxury of waiting on the cold Santa Barbara County sites to slowly accumulate sugar and riper flavors. Without any heatwaves, the acid levels hung high, creating an epic rosé vintage.</p>

<p><strong>Sensory</strong> Precise and popping with bright energy, 2021 Love You Bunches rosé immediately wins us over in everything we want out of a scrumptious rosé. Strawberry married with cool, firm peach. Breezy lemon-lime and lifting mint combine effortlessly through the light and playful palate. Smooth, with just a hint of refreshing tang as the curtain closes on us wanting more.</p>

      <li>“This carbonic Sangiovese is all about freshness, starting with aromas of crushed red currant, raspberry, watermelon, and red flowers. Very light in the glass, the wine is tremendously zippy on the sip and nearly effervescent, offering easy-to-quaff flavors of melon and berry.” — Matt Kettmann</li>
      <li>(Rosé also 91pts) “A delicate shade of crystal pink in the glass, this bottling’s very light nose offers hints of lemon pith and a touch of cherry. It’s extremely textural on the palate, where a chalky structure carries subtle yet refreshing flavors of strawberry and rosebud.” —Matt Kettman</li>
