<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<p>Williams Selyem Winery began as a simple dream of two friends, Ed Selyem and Burt Williams, who started weekend winemaking as a hobby in 1979 in a garage in Forestville, California. It took less than two decades from their first commercial vintage in 1981 for Burt and Ed to create a cult-status winery of international acclaim. Together, they set a new standard for Pinot Noir winemaking in the United States, raising Sonoma Countyâ€™s Russian River Valley to among the best winegrowing regions in the world. The Pinot Noir for this blend was sourced from four unique sties along Eastside Road: Foss Vineyard, Calegari Vineyard, Hunt Ryd Vineyard, and Lone Oak Vineyards</p>

<p><strong>Harvest</strong> â†’ The 2020 growing season started out very dry and bud break was delayed. Early spring rains recharged with soil profile, but periods of extreme cold caused many frost events throughout the Russian River Valley. Late spring yielded ample sunshine and moderate temperatures, and the plants responded very well with excellent canopy growth. The season ended up approximately 12% warmer than average and did not have any heat spikes until August. Harvest started in haste on August 12, ahead of an extreme heat wave. On the night of August 17, the weather changed and there was a rare dry lightning storm that sparked a fire on a hillside in remote west Sonoma County; later named the Walbridge Fire. In the Russian River Valley, it took a number of days for smoke to settle. Based on test results for smoke taint on the grapes, several coastal vineyards were not picked. For the vineyards which were picked, either before the fire or before the smoke settled, the result was concentrated wines with a darker, more brooding complexion. The polish of the tannin, coupled with excellent concentration, should allow for a wide drinking window.</p>

<p>Strawberry and red fruits jump from the glass in this multifaceted wine. Complexed with notes of sassafras and bergamot, aromas of dried rose petal are layered in the nose and offer up classic Pinot Noir perfume. In the mouth, the wine has a sense of roundness and harmony that is satisfying and refreshing. Dark red fruit flavors mix with hints of cocoa and wood spices. Sourced from various vineyards in the Russian River Valley including some younger blocks from the various Estate vineyards.</p>
