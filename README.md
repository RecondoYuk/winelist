# Welcome to the Wine List!

Dukes Beachhouse Maui just revamped our winelist, so I decided to put together a website full of all the information I or my teammates could possibly need to sell the new wines. It's not pretty, but I'm not a designer, so take it with a grain of salt.

Also, I have a lot of information in here so here are ways to bypass all the information:

## By Style
So you want to know what kind of wines we have? You can click on any of these links to see the list of that style of wine:
### White Wines
 - [Bubbly Wines](style_pages/Bubbly.md)  
 - [Pinot Grigios](style_pages/Pinot_Grigio.md)  
 - [Sauvignon Blancs](style_pages/Sauvignon_Blancs.md)  
 - [Chardonnays](style_pages/Chardonnays.md)  
 - [Rosés](style_pages/Rose.md)  
 - [Rieslings](style_pages/Riesling.md)

### All the Styles
Or you can just click on [this page](list_pages/Dukes_Wines_By_Style.md) to go through all of the styles on one page

## By the Guest's Preference
So your guests says "I want a . . . " 

The list on [this page](list_pages/Wines_By_Guest.md) walks you through some simple requests you're likely to come across.

## By the wine's Component
So you have a guest that wants a dryer wine, or maybe they want the wine with the highest or lowest alcohol, or other aspects of the wines.  

If you want to see a list of our [wines by alcohol content](list_pages/Dukes_Wines_by_Alcohol.md).  
If you want to see a list of our [wines by acidity](list_pages/Dukes_Wines_By_Acidity.md).  
If you want to see a list of our [wines by body](list_pages/Dukes_Wines_By_Body.md).  
If you want to see a list of our [wines by dryness](list_pages/Dukes_Wines_by_Dryness.md).  

Why is nothing showing up from here?
## All the Wines

### Bulk List
If you want to see a combination of all my notes on the different wine bottles (notes from tech sheets mostly), [click here](list_pages/Dukes_Wine_List.md).

### Pages and Tech Sheets
Here's a page for each wine where you can find a whole bunch more information about the wine as well as the winery. These are really just the outlines I used to fill out as I scraped through the individual wine websites (all linked) as well as their tech sheets.

After that you will find a link to the individual tech sheets for those wines.
