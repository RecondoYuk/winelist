## Provenance
### Winery
**Story/History** → Tyler is dedicated to producing wines of delicacy and balance, where structure and nuance are favored above all else. Their focus is exclusively on exceptional vineyard sites throughout the Santa Rita Hills and Santa Maria Valley within Santa Barbara County, and feel Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are the best mediums to express each vineyard site. Within these two appellations, the unique combination of marine-based soils, transverse ranges and valleys, and cool ocean influence make this a truly wonderful place for growing Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.
