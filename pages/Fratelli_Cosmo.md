## Provenance
### Winery 
Prosecco is an Italian sparkling wine made in Northeast Italy with the Glera Grape. It is usually off-dry and contains more fruit/residual sugar than most sparkling wines we are used to. The original “Bellini” recipe calls for Prosecco. This fragrant version uses fruit from the finest vineyards in the zone of Cordignano, Sarmede, and Cappella Maggiore in the hills of Treviso. The three Cosmo brother or “Fratelli” in Italian are known as the Prosecco Brothers: Umberto, Luigi, and Domenico
### Region
**Treviso, Italy**
This fragrant, delicate Prosecco Rose is a quality selection of the finest Glera and Pinot Noir grapes grown in individual vineyard parcels in the province of Treviso, where limestone-rich soils ensure a firm structure to the wines here.
**Vineyards** → The vineyards, all within the Prosecco DOC zone, face south-southeast at elevations of 70-250 meters. The climate is temperate, with cold winters, warm summers, and consistent ventilation, while the day-night temperature differentials are moderate.
### Winemaking 
* The vines, dense-planted at an average of 4,000 per hectare, are trained to a mixture of spurred cordon and Sylvoz. The grapes are picked exclusively by hand, around mid-September; yields in must average 90 hl/ha.
* **Vinification**  → After the clusters are destemmed and the grapes pressed, the must spends a brief period on the skins and then is gently pressed off wtih a bladder press. The must is then gravity settled and fermented at 18-20 Celsius. Effervescence is achieved via the Italian Method in 30hl steel pressure fermenters over a period of minimum two months.

### Points of Distinction
### Food Pairing
An outstanding sipping wine, but its full body and firm structure make it a beautiful partner to first courses of fish and vegetables, as well as to traditional Italian tomato-based preparations. The adventuresome should try it with young goat and ewes-milk cheese. It will be at its best over the two years following the harvest, and if stored away from light and heat, its bouquet and palate will achieve impressive maturity.
