<h2 id="provenance">Provenance</h2>
<h3 id="winery">Winery</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The house was founded in 1772 by Philippe Clicquot-Muiron</li>
  <li>It was his son’s widow Madamoisele Nicole-Barbe Ponsardin who established the company as a supplier to the royal courts.
    <ul>
      <li>She was credited with inventing the “Riddling Rack” that allows the degorgement of the sediment from the wines before bottling</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="region">Region</h3>
<p><strong>Champagne, France</strong></p>

<p>The vineyards of Champagne are planted in 3 distinct areas south of the city of Reims.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The “Montagne de Reims” is predominately planted with Pinot Noir
    <ul>
      <li>This is the backbone of the Champagne blend</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The “Cote des Blancs” are chalky slopes south of the town of Epernay that are ideally suited for Chardonnay</li>
  <li>The “Vallee de la Marne” is dominated by Pinot Meunier which is more able to withstand the frosts that the area are susceptible to due to the grape’s later budding</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="winemaking">Winemaking</h3>
<p>A champagne House is eventually judged on the quality of its Brut non vintage. It is in the making of such a wine that the true Art of Champagne blending reveals itself. This is an art in which the House of Veuve Clicquot excels. Our Brut Yellow Label reflects the superb vineyards we own and the consistent nature of our House style. The predominance of Pinot Noir provides the structure that is so typically Clicquot, while a touch of Pinot Meunier rounds out the blend. Chardonnay adds the elegance and finesse essential in a perfectly balanced wine.</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="wine">Wine</h2>
<h3 id="grapes">Grapes</h3>
<p>50-55% Pinot Noir / 15 - 20% Pinot Meunier / 28 - 33% Chardonnay</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grapes from as many as 50 to 60 different <em>Crus</em> go to the blending of Brut Yellow Label. The Cellar Master has to achieve the total consistency of taste, which makes Brut Yellow Label so immediately recognizable, so utterly reliable both in terms of quality, color, and bouquet. He will draw on priceless reserve wines for the blend: from 25 to 35%, sometimes as much as 40% to ensure the continuity of the House style. Each of these older wines - perhaps nine years old - is kept separately to preserve the unique qualities of the vineyard and the vintage.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tasting-notes">Tasting Notes</h3>
<p>First, Brut Yellow Label looks beautiful: golden-yellow, with a foaming necklace of tiny bubbles. Next it is so pleasing to the nose: initially reminiscent of white fruits and raisins, then of vanilla and later of brioche. Note the fine balance between the fruity aromas coming from the grape varieties and the toasty aromas following the aging in the bottle. The first sip delivers all the freshness and forcefulness so typical of Yellow Label with a symphony of fruit tastes following on. Here is a true member of the powerful Brut family, well structured, admirably vinous. The lingering aromas echo and re-echo, with each fruit or spice note distinct.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The dominant Pinot Noir, with over 50% of the blend, ensures an assertive, powerfully structured champagne true to tradition. It has a fine, lively mousse, pleasant nose of hawthorn flowers, musk and fresh bread, which yields to a harmonious palate of lingering apples and pears.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>
